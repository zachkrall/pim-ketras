Ah ah eh
Ah ah eh
Ah ah eh

Spotlight on me
I'm gonna get where I wanna go tonight
(Tonight, tonight, yeah)
Taking your word
Excitement mixed with energy and light
(Uhh ow ow)
It's like a bubble that's about to pop
The energy, it's coming from inside
(Inside, baby)
It's like a secret that you can't explore
You're gonna keep on trying all your life
(Life)

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

It keeps you out
[?]
There's no doubt
Attention
It pushed you to the limit and beyond
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
It is stuck inside your mind
Your body
Everywhere else you do not know
(How can you know, know, know)
If you are trying to push it away
It's gonna stay
A life long

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

Is electronic so hypnotic
Don't try to get rid of it
Come out is automatic
Keeping your whole brain in synch
Automatic, so pathetic
[?]
Keeping you all day ecstatic
Supersonic can't control

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic....
