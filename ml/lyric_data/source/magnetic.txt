Time doesn't stop for me to take a turn
When my lighter's caught a fire [?]
It's beautiful and I don't wanna go
So powerful, I lose control
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Is this magnetism that I'm holding on
Feels like I'm losing my direction
Are you magnetic?
Are you magnetic?

Imagination no reality
[?] are full of chemistry
If I stay too long, this pain inside my head
But if I leave I'm missing it too bad
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Is this magnetism that I'm holding on
Feels like I'm losing my direction
Are you magnetic?
Are you magnetic?
Hold me closer with your energy
I am searching for my gravity
Are you magnetic?
Are you magnetic?
