[Verse 1]
I, I don't know why
You can make me feel
Like everything I do is never enough
Yeah I, I try to change
I just can't get it right
But you know that I try with all that I got

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've tried to be what you want me to be
But I can't do it
Try to sugarcoat how it feels
'Cause what is to it?
And it makes no sense to me
That you gotta make me feel so small
You call it out in one, two, three

[Chorus]
Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to

[Verse 2]
I, I don't know why
You can talk me down
And make what I say sound so insecure
Inside, I'm screaming out
You put me in a box
But still I can't stop to reach out for more

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've tried to change what you want me to change
But I can't do it
And it makes no sense to me

[Chorus]
Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to

[Bridge]
Call me whatever
Your words don't mean a thing
Call me whatever
I'll find another dream
Call me whatever
Your words don't mean a thing
Call me an alien
Call me an alien

[Chorus]
Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to
