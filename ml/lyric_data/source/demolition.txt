[Verse 1]
There are times he puts me in the trash
Then I cry and then he wants me back
Trash me like in an ice crusher
So cold, like Russian vodka
Still I can't resist, it's so bad
You hit me with your kung fu, I get mad
Sometimes when it gets bad, I wanna go
This demolition cannot be controlled

[Chorus]
'Cause this boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me

[Verse 2]
All the time he stabbed me in the back
A Range Rover, on a Cadillac
You are my monster, baby
Italian martini
It's like the devil in a human shell
One more kiss and I will go to hell

[Chorus]
'Cause this boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me

[Bridge]
Yeah, I gave you the permission
To tear my heart apart
I guess I didn't really listen
He told me from the start
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me

[Chorus]
This boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Tear my heart apart
