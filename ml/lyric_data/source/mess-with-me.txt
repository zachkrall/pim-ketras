[Intro: Kim Petras]
Mess with me, you gotta mess with me
Mess with me, you gotta mess with me
Mess with me, you gotta mess with me

[Verse 1: Kim Petras]
Mess with me, oh baby
1,2,3 got clarity
Diamonds on, no charity
This (ah!) is a rarity (oh whoa)

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Petras]
Mess with me, oh hunny
Mess with me, yeah

[Chorus: Kim Petras]
Mess with me, I'm your darling queen (yeah)
Mess with me, baby please
Mess with me

[Verse 2: MARINA]
Take it up with me
I'll show who you're meant to be
But if you waste my time
You won't be mine (mine)
My heart grows like a maple tree
Cut the roots and I'll make you bleed
So don't try to mess with me (with me)
With me, with me, with me

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Petras]
Mess with me, oh hunny
Mess with me
Mess with me, you gotta mess with marina

[Chorus: Kim Petras & MARINA]
Mess with me, I'm your darling queen (yeah)
Mess with me, baby please
Mess with me
Mess with me, I'm your darling queen (yeah)
Mess with me, baby please
Mess with me

[Outro: Kim Petras & MARINA]
Mess with me baby
Mess with me baby
Root like the trees
Mess with me baby

Woo-aah!
