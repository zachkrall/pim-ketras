[Chorus]
I want all my clothes designer (Ooh!)
I want someone else to buy 'em (Yeah!)
If I cannot get it right now (Now!)
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
Give me all of your attention (Ooh!)
Give me summer in the Hamptons (Yeah!)
If I cannot get it right now (Now!)
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all

[Verse 1]
I want a little bit of this and that
I take a sip of this and a hit at that
I'mma have everything on the rack
Aw yeah, aw yeah
And if you give me everything I want
Baby maybe you could be the one
We can kick it, we can have some fun
Aw yeah, aw yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't you fight it
Close your eyes and swipe it
Maybe I could be with you
If you buy me diamonds
And you keep me smiling
Baby, I can be with you

[Chorus]
I want all my clothes designer (Ooh!)
I want someone else to buy 'em (Yeah!)
If I cannot get it right now (Now!)
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
Give me all of your attention (Ooh!)
Give me summer in the Hamptons (Yeah!)
If I cannot get it right now (Now!)
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all

[Verse 2]
If you wanna get down tonight
You better hook it up at the place I like
Better make it fit like the perfect size
Aw yeah, aw yeah
And if you give me everything I want
You go from none to number one
Yeah, you're so cute, yeah, you're so fun
Aw yeah, aw yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't you fight it
Close your eyes and swipe it
Maybe I could be with you
If you buy me diamonds
And you keep me smiling
Baby, I can be with you
Oh, with you

[Chorus]
I want all my clothes designer (Ooh!)
I want someone else to buy 'em (Yeah!)
If I cannot get it right now (Now!)
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
Give me all of your attention (Ooh!)
Give me summer in the Hamptons (Yeah!)
If I cannot get it right now (Now!)
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all

[Bridge]
Woo ah!
I don't want it all
Give me summer in the Hamptons
Give me summer in the Hamptons
(I don't want it at all)
Give me summer in the Hamptons
In the Hamptons
In the Hamptons
I want all I want

[Chorus]
I want all my clothes designer (Ooh!)
I want someone else to buy 'em (Yeah!)
If I cannot get it right now (Now!)
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
Give me all of your attention (Ooh!)
Give me summer in the Hamptons (Yeah!)
If I cannot get it right now (Now!)
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want it at all
