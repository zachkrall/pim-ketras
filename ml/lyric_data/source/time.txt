[Verse 1]
The time is passing fast and there is
No way to get it back because it's
High speed, it goes around and doesn't
Even do a sound and there is
No time to catch a breath and
When it's gone it's lost in space and there is
Nothing to make me stop
I wanna get in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head

[Chorus]
Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All of our dreams (all of our dreams)
All of the things (all of the things)
We should've done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

[Verse 2]
We thought we last forever but
Pushing set and never rest and there is
Anger for everything
And there is no chance to win
Into the way, all the place
Are we really lost a stance?
What's right and what is wrong?
Now all we've done is on

[Pre-Chorus]
It change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head

[Chorus]
Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All of our dreams (all of our dreams)
All of the things (all of the things)
We should've done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

[Bridge]
I was going on (on and on)
Running on and on (on and on)
It will never stop (never stop)
It will never stop (never stop)
There's no time to breathe (time to breathe)
Back and fall asleep (fall asleep)
It's running on and on (on and on)
Time

[Chorus]
Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All of our dreams (all of our dreams)
All of the things (all of the things)
We should've done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

[Outro]
Running, running on and on, it's running on and on
And it will never stop, it will never stop
The time, more time, more time, more time
Oh, oh
