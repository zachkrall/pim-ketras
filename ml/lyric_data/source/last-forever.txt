[Verse 1]
Whatever it is that makes this feeling
It’s in everybody’s heart
It’s the moment that is so perfect
Like in a movie but better

[Pre-Chorus]
When the moment has come
It is magic, so fun
Every question you ask
Everything is answered
It’s a dream coming true
And it happens to you
Make this moment
Last, last, last, yeah

[Chorus]
Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Make this moment last forever
It is just a chance
Please never let it stop
It is inside your heart
Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Don’t you ever let it end

[Verse 2]
No matter who you are it happens somewhen
It is something you remember
It’s the moment that is so perfect
Nobody ever can take it away

[Pre-Chorus]
When the moment has come
It is magic, so fun
Every question you ask
Everything is answered
It’s a dream coming true
And it happens to you
Make this moment
Last, last, last, yeah

[Chorus]
Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Make this moment last forever
It is just a chance
Please never let it stop
It is inside your heart
Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Don’t you ever let it end

[Bridge]
Make this moment never end
It is just a chance
In your mind and in your memory
Take it, make it
Last forever

[Chorus]
Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Make this moment last forever
It is just a chance
Please never let it stop
It is inside your heart
Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
