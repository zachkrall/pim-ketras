[Intro]
Start!
Ooh
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
My silhouette is in the frame of your shades again
And your cigarette's facing its final breath
Just once or twice is too many times when you know the end
So hard to deny, so hard to forget

[Chorus]
Hillside boys, you call my name
You make my heart sparkle like champagne
(Oh me, oh my)
You break my love machine
Yeah, hillside boys, you call my name
Yeah, you call my name
Oh, you call my name
Yeah, you call my name
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

[Verse 2]
Why do I try, when in your eyes I just melt again?
And you'll only stay until our tan lines match
Oh, it's over in your, in your Range Rover
And I don't, don't know why I want ya
But you look so pretty when you're breaking me, yeah

[Chorus]
Hillside boys, you call my name
You make my heart sparkle like champagne
(Oh me, oh my)
You break my love machine
Yeah, hillside boys, you call my name
Yeah, you call my name
Oh, you call my name (my name)
Yeah, you call my name
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

[Bridge]
Paco Rabanne, One Million
Eau de parfum on your sweater
I'll carry on
Summer is done, done, and so are we

[Chorus]
Hillside boys, you call my name
You make my heart sparkle like champagne
(Oh me, oh my)
You break my love machine
Yeah, hillside boys, you call my name (oh, you call my name)
Yeah, you call my name (you call)
Oh, you call my name (my name, my name, my name)
Yeah, you call my name
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
