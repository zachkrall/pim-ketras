Painkillers won’t do, ‘cause though you’re gone
I still got your taste on the tip of my tongue

Yellow umbrella on it
Drink it, I put it on ya
I know I look stellar in it
Your eyes so red
But it’s so Valentino
Keep it in the black bucket
Hope that they don’t see your stash
Even if I'm [?] perfection
You’re my obsession
My favourite distraction, yeah
The tall trees
That’s where you'll find me
But please don’t remind me
Please don’t remind me that
