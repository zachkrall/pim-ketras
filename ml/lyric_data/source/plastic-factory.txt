[Verse 1]
I get up, get up out that door
Sometimes I can't take this shit no more
There's a million people
But they're all alone
Everybody's looking at their telephone
It's only about the good looks
'Bout your clothes, your car, and your neighborhood
Some people only look like gold
Well, that is only till the truth unfolds

[Pre-Chorus]
But I wanna be free of this
I'm not a piece of plastic
They say live and let live
But no one acts like it
I put on my mask again
Can't let them see who I am, who I am

[Chorus]
Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
Said I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
Yeah we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic

[Verse 2]
I get up, get up one more time
I look in the mirror, put on a smile
Everybody always looks so mad
Is it my fault that you are depressed?
He said he's gonna put my record out
But only if I take my clothes off now
Where have all these values gone
Now everybody is replaceable

[Pre-Chorus]
But I wanna be free of this
I'm not a piece of plastic
They say live and let live
But no one acts like it
I put on my mask again
Can't let them see who I am, who I am

[Chorus]
Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
Said I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
How we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic

[Bridge]
So what they say?
Fake it till you make it
Shake it till you break it
Move ya money maker up and down
Nobody cares about what's inside
As long as you make that booty go round
Cause real quick you'll be called a bitch
Cause you break somebody's heart
So you gotta make the best of it
Grab a bottle drink it up

[Verse 3]
Okay
I got a heart
I got a brain
I got a life
It's half insane
But I don't care
Bout what they say
I'm gonna stop my masquerade
My masquerade

[Chorus]
Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and Silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
How we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
