[Intro]
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna-
Oh, it's hot!

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna wait for my life to be over
I don't wanna wait till there's no ice in my cup to melt up
I don't wanna wake up with no disclosure
Mh, how do you know if you never try, never try
You better, mmm, just a little bit, mmm, just a little bit
I don't wanna wait for the night to be over, mm mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Get it right, get it right, babe
Don't you deny that
I got it right, got it right too
Tell me what you're gonna do

[Chorus]
Can we skip the sweet talk, sweet talk
Cause I know what I want, you got it
Time up, time up
I want it right now, want it right now
No sweet talk, sweet talk
Cause I know what you want
I got it down, down, down, down, down
I want it right now, want it right now

[Post-Chorus]
Sweet talk, sweet talk, sweet talk
I want it right now, want it right, mmm

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna wait for my life to be over
Don't make me wait till there's no ice in my cup to melt up
I gotta know if you're gonna get closer, mh
I wanna know if you never try, never try
You gotta, mmm, just a little bit, mmm, just a little bit, ah ah
I don't wanna wait for the night to be over

[Pre-Chorus]
Get it right, get it right, babe
Don't you deny that
I got it right, got it right too
Tell me what you're gonna do

[Chorus]
Can we skip the sweet talk, sweet talk
Cause I know what I want, you got it
Time up, time up
I want it right now, want it right now
No sweet talk, sweet talk
Cause I know what you want
I got it down, down, down, down, down
I want it right now, want it right now

[Post-Chorus]
Sweet talk, sweet talk, sweet talk, no no, sweet talk

[Bridge]
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait

[Pre-Chorus]
Get it right, get it right, babe
Don't you deny that
I got it right, got it right too
Tell me what you're gonna do

Can we skip the sweet talk
Cause I know what I want, you got it
Time up, time up, time up, time up

[Chorus]
Can we skip the sweet talk, sweet talk
Cause I know what I want, you got it
Time up, time up
I want it right now, want it right now
No sweet talk, sweet talk
Cause I know what you want
I got it down, down, down, down, down
I want it right now, want it right now

[Post-Chorus]
Sweet talk, right now, sweet talk, sweet talk
Sweet talk, mh
