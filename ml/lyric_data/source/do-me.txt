[Chorus]
Do me, do me, do me like that
Hurt me so good, make me wanna be bad
Give it to me, to me like that
Feels so good, got me coming right back

[Verse 1]
Touch me, touch me there, right there
Kiss it, lick it, flip it
Leave your handprints on my ass, yeah
Won't get to the bed, to the bed
Counter in the kitchen, bathroom mirrors, on the stairs, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I love when you love me back to back
Baby, be my QB while I'm throwin' it back
Swear you're no good for me, that's a fact
Don't need to talk about it, save your breath

[Chorus]
Do me, do me, do me like that
Hurt me so good, make me wanna be bad
Give it to me, to me like that
Feels so good, got me coming right back
(Do me) Do me, do me, do me like that (Like that)
Hurt me so good, make me wanna be bad
(Give it) Give it to me, to me like that (Like that)
Feels so good, got me coming right back

[Verse 2]
Neighbours gotta know how we go
Couple hundred rounds, knock it down to the floor now
Had me hittin' notes, high notes
Seven to eleven, boy, you do me straight to heaven now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I love when you make me come back to back
And my legs are shakin', nobody does it like that
Swear you know my body, you don't need a map
Just give it to me harder, I can take it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Do me, do me, do me like that
Hurt me so good, make me wanna be bad
Give it to me, to me like that (Like that)
Feels so good, got me coming right back (Do it to me)
Do me, do me, do me like that (Like that)
Hurt me so good, make me wanna be bad
(Make me wanna be bad)
(Give it) Give it to me, to me like that (Like that)
Feels so good, got me coming right back
Do me

[Bridge]
Do me, do me, yeah
Woo-ah!
Do me, do me
Do it to me

[Chorus]
Do me, do me, do me like that
Hurt me so good, make me wanna be bad
(Make me wanna be bad)
Give it to me, to me like that (Give it to me like that)
Feels so good, got me coming right back
(Got me c-c-c-c-coming)
Do me, do me, do me like that (Like that)
Hurt me so good, make me wanna be bad
(Make me wanna be bad)
(Give it) Give it to me, to me like that (Like that)
Feels so good (Coming), got me coming right back
Got me coming right back
