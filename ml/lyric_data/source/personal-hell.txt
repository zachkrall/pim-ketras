[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Summer sun, don't feel a thing
Overthink 'bout everything
When I think of you, you give me chills
Yeah, I'm sad, but down to fuck
Want you more, this ain't enough
When you kiss me, boy, I don't need pills

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, come on over to me
Come set me free
Baby, come on, got what I need
Hands all over me, oh

[Chorus]
Save me from my personal Hell (Yeah, yeah)
Break me, break me out of myself (Yeah, yeah)
Touch me, only your hands make me come alive
Save me from my personal Hell (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Family says that I need help
Late at night, I touch myself
I've been saving all of this for you
Exorcise my demons, yeah
Tainted love could get me there
I've been saving all of this for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, come on over to me
Come set me free
Baby, come on, got what I need
Hands all over me, oh

[Chorus]
Save me from my personal Hell (Yeah, yeah)
Break me, break me out of myself (Yeah, yeah)
Touch me, only your hands make me come alive
Save me from my personal Hell (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Woo-ah!
Baby, baby, love me, hate me
Make me feel alive
Baby, baby, drive me crazy
Bring me back to life

[Chorus]
Save me from my personal Hell (Yeah, yeah)
Break me, break me out of myself (Yeah, yeah)
Touch me, only your hands make me come alive (Make me come alive)
Save me from my personal Hell (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Ooh-ah
