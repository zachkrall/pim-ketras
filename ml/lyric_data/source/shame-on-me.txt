[Intro]
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 1]
Leaving you was easy to say
Harder on me every day
Places I keep stumblin' into you
All you were was a sweet escape
With a bitter aftertaste
Only got myself to blame

[Pre-Chorus]
I get high, every Friday
Waste my time, every Sunday
Bottle of wine on a Monday
I just keep on spiraling down

[Chorus]
Shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I do I can't keep you and keep me too
Say shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I see you still remain a part of me
Say shame on me

[Post-Chorus]
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 2]
Losing me was the first mistake
Wished there was a pill to take
'Cause I still see you in every face
Try to shake you off like a Polaroid
Subconsciously paranoid
Only got myself to blame

[Pre-Chorus]
I get wild every Friday
Low on life on a Sunday
I just can't get out of my way, I try
But I just keep on spiralin' down

[Chorus]
Shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I do
I can't keep you and keep me too
Say shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I see
You still remain a part of me
Say shame on me

[Post-Chorus]
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Bridge]
You're still there
Like a pounding in my head
And it keeps on coming back
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
You're still there
And I'm still calling out you're name
I'm the only one to blame
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on me
Oh-oh ah-ah
No matter what I do
I can't keep you and keep me too

Say shame on me
Oh-oh ah-ah, say shame on me
Shame on me, no, no, no
Uh, uh-uh
No, no, no, no, no
Shame on me
Uh, uh-uh
Shame on me
No, no, no, no
