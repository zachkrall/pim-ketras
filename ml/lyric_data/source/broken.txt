[Chorus]
You made it hurt too much
Hope you got, hope you got
Everything you want
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)
So much for the love
Hope she got, hope she got
Everything I'm not
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

[Verse 1]
You cut me open, I cried oceans
All I wanted was devotion
I got nothing
Hope you happy with your new bitch
How you livin'?
I'm in Paris in Marc Jacobs, life's amazing
When she leave you for your best friend
That shit karma
When you see me with my new dude
That's a come up
Yeah, you used to have the baddest
Lookin' lavish, dipped in carats
Only want me back when you can't have me

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to do it all for you
I used to give it all to you

[Chorus]
You made it hurt too much
Hope you got, hope you got
Everything you want
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)
So much for the love
Hope she got, hope she got
Everything I'm not
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

[Verse 2]
You don't even know what you did to me
Tears fall like rain, man
You broke my heart baby, literally
I just can't take it
Couldn't eat, sleep for days
And my mind going four ways
Bottle of Jack half-empty
In and out of bed, sitting in the hallway
You don't know the tears that I cried
You don't want to see my dark side
And my mind going psycho
Hated that you wasted my time
Friends thought I was insane
Almost tatted your name
Ask God to do to you what you did to me
At night when I pray

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to do it all for you
I used to give it all to you

[Chorus]
You made it hurt too much
Hope you got, hope you got
Everything you want
Pray to God, pray to God (Pray to God, baby)
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)
So much for the love
Hope she got, hope she got (Hope she got everything I'm not)
Everything I'm not
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

[Outro]
Every day I hope you're broken-hearted (Hearted)
Every night I hope you're broken-hearted (Hearted)
Every day I hope you're broken-hearted (Hearted)
Yeah, broken-hearted (Hearted)
Woo-ah!
(Hearted, hearted, hearted)
