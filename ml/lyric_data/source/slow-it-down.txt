[Verse 1]
Boys like you like it when it's goin' down
I got you, and I ain't tryna stop it now
Your body, I'm gettin' it confused with love
My body, you're never gonna get enough

[Chorus]
Baby, slow it down (Just for a minute)
It's goin' down (You're gonna get it)
(Ooh) I wanna (cross the line)
But you just gotta take your time
Baby, slow it down (Just for a minute)
It's goin' down (You're gonna get it)
(Ooh) I wanna (cross the line)
But you just gotta take your time
Baby, slow it down, mmm

[Verse 2]
Boys like you never wanna slow it down
I got you
Lean back and let me show you how
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, slow it down (Just for a minute)
It's goin' down (You're gonna get it)
(Ooh) I wanna (cross the line)
But you just gotta take your time
Baby, slow it down (Just for a minute)
It's goin' down (You're gonna get it)
(Ooh) I wanna (cross the line)
But you just gotta take your time
Baby, slow it down

[Bridge]
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Slow it down)
Woo-ah!
(Baby, baby, slow, slow)
(You know what I want, want)
(Slow it down)
Baby, let me show you how (You how)
Baby, slow it down

[Chorus]
Baby, slow it down (Just for a minute)
It's goin' down (You're gonna get it)
(Ooh) I wanna (cross the line)
But you just gotta take your time
Baby, slow it down (Just for a minute)
It's goin' down (You're gonna get it)
(Ooh) I wanna (cross the line)
But you just gotta take your time
Baby, slow it down
