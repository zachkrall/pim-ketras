You made a potion and I gave it a taste
In slow motion you showed another face
Every word you whisper, demons in my head
Babe, you have me beat and it's killing me

You play your cards and the weather is raging
You're rearranging the storms we're exchanging
Put your spell on me, on me

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared
I declare bittersweet surrender

Chilling shivers running up my spine
Words that echo when I call you mine, woo
And everything you promised that you never did
Take the pain away while I fade to gray

You play your cards and the weather is raging
You're rearranging the storms we're exchanging
Put your spell on me, on me

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared
I declare bittersweet surrender

You're like a devil in disguise
I begged you to see the light
But you beg to differ, ooh
Baby, don't let me escape
Hunt me down, I'm yours to take
Baby, captivate me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, ooh

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared
I declare bittersweet
I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared
I declare bittersweet surrender

Bittersweet surrender
