If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

I been out West in LA, and shit
All my exes want attention, I ain't payin' it
I ain't spent a thing off my latest check
Funny thing we ain't even in a relationship
Hallucinogenic
Don't know how long I been trippin'
But I'm sippin' and I'm kickin' it with you
It's been a lot of fun
Puffin', puffin', passin'
We made love, we made it happen
We got passion
We did things you probably hadn't even thought of yet

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze, and it feels so good

If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

I been out West in LA, and shit
Smoking things, chasing dreams
On some player shit
Thinking I might buy a chain with my latest flip
You just gotta run your feet
I'm running through the check
Player hating on me 'cause she told me she was single
But you see just how I'm rocking and you couldn't really blame him
We was puffin', puffin', passin'
We was fuckin', we was laughin'
We had passion
We was doing things that you couldn't even imagine, yeah

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze and it feels so good

If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

You can hit me, you can hit me
Yeah, you know where I'm at
(Where I'm at, where I'm at, I gotcha)
And I wanna, and I wanna make sure you won't forget
(Won't forget, won't forget, I gotcha)
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
Every time that we hang
(That we hang, that we hang, I gotcha)
Pass it over, pass it over
Do it over again, do it over again, do it over again


If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills, yeah
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

I gotcha
