O-o-o-o-one days up
Two days up
Three days up
We don't stop, we don't stop, we don't stop

I never, I never quit
I got a bag in my bag
Look at my, look at my fit
You know you want some of that
We 'bout to, we 'bout to dip
All of my girls, where you at?
La la la, la la la, lit
I gotta throw all this cash

Oh no, I get lonely when I'm solo

Oh, woah
We don't stop, we don't stop, we don't stop
Oh, woah
We don't stop, we don't stop, we don't stop

Mix up the, mix up the juice
Don't ask me what's in my cup
Do what we, do what we do
I'll keep it, I'll keep it up
Let's make a move, make a move
I haven't partied enough
I wanna party with Jesus
I wanna party with Jesus

Oh no, I get lonely when I'm solo
