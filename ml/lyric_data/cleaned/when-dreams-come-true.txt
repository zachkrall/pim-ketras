Come dance with me all night, all night

Tell me why I wonder, wonder why
Since I know you
I think bout your body every day
'Cuz everything seems so picture perfect
My heart was broken by another guy

What can you dream
When your dreams come true?
Since I am with you, I lost the view
Will I ever become the one for you?

No matter what I do
I'm in love with you
(Come dance with me all night, all night)

Your kiss tasted bittersweet

What can you dream
When your dreams come true?
Since I am with you, I lost the view
Will I ever become the one for you?

No matter what I do
I'm in love with you
(Come dance with me all night, all night)


(Come dance with me all night, all night)
(Come dance with me all night, all night)
(Come dance with me all night, all night)
(Come dance with me all night, all night)
