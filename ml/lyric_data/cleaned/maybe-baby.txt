Uh, It's time!

Baby baby, pour all of your love on me
Baby baby, I've been waiting so patiently
Maybe baby, you got all the sugar I need

Hold on to me and don't let me go
Don't you let, don't you let me go
Don't you know I'm sweet like cotton candy
I'm sweet like candy, sweet like candy
And if you pick me then you get a piece
You get a piece, you get a piece

Give me all of you, I want it
Save it all for me
For me, yep
I am yours just say you want it
I give you the key

Baby baby, pour all of your love on me
Baby baby, I've been waiting so patiently
Maybe baby, you got all the sugar I need

The rest is up, the rest is up to you
Say I'm all you need, say you love me truth
Say you love me

Give me all of you, I want it
Save it all for me
For me, yep
I am yours just say you want it
I give you the key
Yep!

Baby baby, pour all of your love on me
Baby baby, I've been waiting so patiently
Maybe baby, you got all the sugar I need

I, I've been wasting all my time
Waiting for a guy like you
So you better tell me what you choose
Do you want my L.O.V.E to the E?
Gotta tell me if you want me
Then say you love me, love me
Yep!

Baby baby, pour all of your love on me
Baby baby, I've been waiting so patiently
Maybe baby, you got all the sugar I need
Baby baby, pour all of your love on me
Baby baby, I've been waiting so patiently
Maybe baby, you got all the sugar I need
