You got it, cuttin' gold up
No straight line, it's gon' go around
Up in your face so you already know
Switch up position is inevitable
Bom-bom it, check your ego
Been done it like mojito
Up in this place like you already own
Gotta make it demonstratable

'Cause if talk is cheap
Then make it worth a million
Gotta max your card on it
On it, on it, on it
If you want it all then you've got to complete it
Say it, say it, got to let me know
Oh, oh, oh

Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Do it like you mean it
Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Don't make me repeat it, oh oh
Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Say it like you need me
Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Do it like, do it like you mean it

Oh!
Like you mean it
Oh!
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Like you mean it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Get down

I got it, it's an equal
Plus, minus for the sequel
Tough for the better if I give it a go
Drum, drum it
Flip the volume
Chew on it like it's gum, darlin'
Gotta make it demonstratable

'Cause if talk is cheap
Then make it worth a million
Gotta max your card on it
On it, on it, on it
If you want it all then you've got to complete it
Say it, say it, got to let me know
Oh, oh, oh

Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Do it like you mean it
Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Don't make me repeat it, oh oh
Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Say it like you need me
Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Do it like, do it like you mean it

Oh!
Like you mean it
Oh!
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Like you mean it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Get down

Talk is cheap, then make it worth a million
Max your card on it
On it, on it, on it
If you want it all, complete it
Say it, say it, got to let me know
Oh, oh

Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Do it like you mean it (like you mean it)
Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Don't make me repeat it, oh oh
Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Say it like you need me
Ey na na, ey na na, ey
Do it like, do it like you mean it

Oh!
Like you mean it
Oh!
Do it, do it, do it, do it (do it like you)
Do it, do it, do it (do it like you)
Like you mean it
Do it, do it, do it, do it (do it like you)
Do it, do it, do it
Like you mean it
