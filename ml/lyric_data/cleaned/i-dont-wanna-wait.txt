I don't wanna wait
It's a little late but you should still come over
I don't wanna wait
All I want is you, you, you-you, you, oh
I don't wanna wait
Gotta get a taste of you to satisfy me
I don't wanna wait
Whatcha gonna do, do, do-do, do, do-do?
Do, do, do-do, do, do-do
Do, do, do-do, do, do-do

I don't wanna ever love again
Go down that road
I don't wanna lover, love again
I don't wanna ever love again
Go down that road
I don't wanna lover, love again
If I...

But my heart got me

I don't wanna wait
It's a little late but you should still come over
I don't wanna wait
All I want is you, you, you-you, you, oh
I don't wanna wait
Gotta get a taste of you to satisfy me
I don't wanna wait
Whatcha gonna do, do, do-do, do, do-do?
Do, do, do-do, do, do-do
Do, do, do-do, do, do-do
