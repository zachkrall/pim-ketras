I, I don't know why
You can make me feel
Like everything I do is never enough
Yeah I, I try to change
I just can't get it right
But you know that I try with all that I got

And I've tried to be what you want me to be
But I can't do it
Try to sugarcoat how it feels
'Cause what is to it?
And it makes no sense to me
That you gotta make me feel so small
You call it out in one, two, three

Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to

I, I don't know why
You can talk me down
And make what I say sound so insecure
Inside, I'm screaming out
You put me in a box
But still I can't stop to reach out for more

And I've tried to change what you want me to change
But I can't do it
And it makes no sense to me

Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to

Call me whatever
Your words don't mean a thing
Call me whatever
I'll find another dream
Call me whatever
Your words don't mean a thing
Call me an alien
Call me an alien

Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to
I need you more than air
I see you everywhere
Nobody else compares
I don't go anywhere

Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
Thought that you were the exception
Took a fatal blow to my heart
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you

Wish I could forget ya, like I never met ya
Said you wanna break, then you broke my heart
You left me with nothing, I feel like I'm drowning
You just let me down and I don't know why
Wish that I could say that you're dead to me
What's it gonna take to feel alive again?
I feel like I'm breaking, I keep medicating
I just can't believe that it's over now

All I do is cry about you
All I do is cry
You're always in my head
Feels like I'm living dead
Remember when you said that this would never end?

Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
Thought that you were the exception
Took a fatal blow to my heart
I just want for you to need me

Tell me that you need me, tell me I'm enough
Tell me everything like I'm the only one you trust (Only one you trust)

You made a potion and I gave it a taste
In slow motion you showed another face
Every word you whisper, demons in my head
Babe, you have me beat and it's killing me

You play your cards and the weather is raging
You're rearranging the storms we're exchanging
Put your spell on me, on me

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared
I declare bittersweet surrender

Chilling shivers running up my spine
Words that echo when I call you mine, woo
And everything you promised that you never did
Take the pain away while I fade to gray

You play your cards and the weather is raging
You're rearranging the storms we're exchanging
Put your spell on me, on me

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared
I declare bittersweet surrender

You're like a devil in disguise
I begged you to see the light
But you beg to differ, ooh
Baby, don't let me escape
Hunt me down, I'm yours to take
Baby, captivate me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, ooh

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared

Tears fall like rain, man
You broke my heart baby, literally

Couldn't eat, sleep for days
And my mind going four ways
Bottle of Jack half-empty
In and out of bed, sitting in the hallway
You don't know the tears that I cried
You don't want to see my dark side
And my mind going psycho
Hated that you wasted my time
Friends thought I was insane
Almost tatted your name
Ask God to do to you what you did to me
At night when I pray

I used to do it all for you
I used to give it all to you

You made it hurt too much
Hope you got, hope you got
Everything you want
Pray to God, pray to God (Pray to God, baby)

There are times he puts me in the trash
Then I cry and then he wants me back
Trash me like in an ice crusher
So cold, like Russian vodka
Still I can't resist, it's so bad
You hit me with your kung fu, I get mad
Sometimes when it gets bad, I wanna go
This demolition cannot be controlled

'Cause this boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me

All the time he stabbed me in the back
A Range Rover, on a Cadillac
You are my monster, baby
Italian martini
It's like the devil in a human shell
One more kiss and I will go to hell

'Cause this boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me

Yeah, I gave you the permission
To tear my heart apart
I guess I didn't really listen
He told me from the start
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me

This boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion

Nothing more I could say
It's you and me
And no one else here
Nothing will stay the same

Because you were never here, never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you see I really want to stay with you
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something?
It's there, it's there, it's there

There's something in the air
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel it
One day is not enough
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel the rush

Na-na na na na na...

Without you only
Now I'm back in your arms
Stay tonight
I'll do what you like
I will do you no harm

Because you're never here or never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you tell I really want you to stay with me
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something
It's there, it's there, it's there

Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
In the air

There's something in the air
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel it
One day is not enough

I can feel it, feel the rush
Feel the touch
Wait up 'til dawn and see those thoughts
I'm asking you
Wish you can stay the night
I'm wanting you to feel it

If you wanna pop one in the hills

Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down

Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills

I been out West in LA, and shit
All my exes want attention, I ain't payin' it
I ain't spent a thing off my latest check
Funny thing we ain't even in a relationship
Hallucinogenic
Don't know how long I been trippin'
But I'm sippin' and I'm kickin' it with you
It's been a lot of fun
Puffin', puffin', passin'
We made love, we made it happen
We got passion
We did things you probably hadn't even thought of yet

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze, and it feels so good

If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

I been out West in LA, and shit
Smoking things, chasing dreams
On some player shit
Thinking I might buy a chain with my latest flip
You just gotta run your feet
I'm running through the check
Player hating on me 'cause she told me she was single
But you see just how I'm rocking and you couldn't really blame him
We was puffin', puffin', passin'
We was fuckin', we was laughin'
We had passion
We was doing things that you couldn't even imagine, yeah

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze and it feels so good

And I wanna, and I wanna make sure you won't forget
(Won't forget, won't forget, I gotcha)
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
Every time that we hang
(That we hang, that we hang, I gotcha)
Pass it over, pass it over
Do it over again, do it over again, do it over again

Time is money, time is money

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Nobody's got the perfect rhyme
The perfect steps, the perfect lines
So what? We keep it rocking, eh
Nobody's stopping for this
You take a shot, the final show
You leave 'em clapping when you go through this
Whatever happens, hey
It doesn't matter for shit, yeah

'Cause no one knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancing to this
With a drink in my hand, a dream in my sights
But we can put it off until tomorrow night

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

They tell you lies, a losing game
A dead end road with no escape, fuck that!
Long as we're ticking
Might as well go out with a bang, yeah

'Cause no one knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancing to this
With a drink in my hand, down for the night
And they'll be poppin' bottles in the afterlife

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Hey, go, where you wanna go
Say what you wanna
Till all my dreams are done
Yeah, I'll be dancing
First time in my life I, I'm not afraid
First time I remember feeling anything, anything
There's no turning back now, I can't be saved
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

I'm the greatest God created
I'm a sickness, I'm contagious
I'm a demon, power trippin'
On a mission, and vindictive
Suffocating, exterminating
And I love it, every second
Full of hatred, irritated
Cut you open for entertainment

Ooh
They'll remember me
Ooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)

And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

Deine Zeit ist abgelaufen
Ich bin dein Alptraum, Ich bin dein Omen
Wenn du mich siehst, fängst du besser an zu laufen
Kannst du glauben!
Sag jetzt deine letzten Worte
Ich krieg' immer was ich wollte
Ich bin das Ende deiner Tage
Ich bin die Krankheit, ich bin die Plage

Ooh
They'll remember me
Ooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
First time I remember feeling anything, anything (anything)

Feels like I'm losing my direction
Are you magnetic?

Hold me closer with your energy

Ooh-ah
Key lime, there's so many flavors, many designs
Popped into my sight, you were so fly
Purple and viola shades pass by
And now you're lookin' in my eyes
In my margarita you're the spice
Tiny pink umbrella on the side, ride
You're my hot air ballon, my binocular zoom, yeah

He got all that I want
'Cause he's gonna see, so marvelously
Made it, made it easy
So I pick him for me, yeah
He got all that I want
Yeah, he's gonna see, most definitely
Made it easy, easy
So I pick him for me, yeah

Velvet, after dress rehearsal and measurements
Pins and needles showed me you're divine
Maraschino cherry patterns slide
The perfect fit, the perfect size
In my margarita you're the ice
Cinnamon and orange on the side, ride

'Cause, he's gonna see, so marvelously
Made it, made it easy
So I pick him for me, yeah
He got all that I want
Yeah, He's gonna see, most definitely
Made it easy, easy
So I pick him for me, yeah
I get up, get up out that door
Sometimes I can't take this shit no more
There's a million people
But they're all alone
Everybody's looking at their telephone
It's only about the good looks
'Bout your clothes, your car, and your neighborhood
Some people only look like gold
Well, that is only till the truth unfolds

But I wanna be free of this
I'm not a piece of plastic
They say live and let live
But no one acts like it
I put on my mask again
Can't let them see who I am, who I am

Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
Said I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
Yeah we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic

I get up, get up one more time
I look in the mirror, put on a smile
Everybody always looks so mad
Is it my fault that you are depressed?
He said he's gonna put my record out
But only if I take my clothes off now
Where have all these values gone
Now everybody is replaceable

But I wanna be free of this
I'm not a piece of plastic
They say live and let live
But no one acts like it
I put on my mask again
Can't let them see who I am, who I am

Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
Said I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
How we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic

So what they say?
Fake it till you make it
Shake it till you break it
Move ya money maker up and down
Nobody cares about what's inside
As long as you make that booty go round
Cause real quick you'll be called a bitch
Cause you break somebody's heart
So you gotta make the best of it
Grab a bottle drink it up

Okay
I got a heart
I got a brain
I got a life
It's half insane
But I don't care
Bout what they say
I'm gonna stop my masquerade
My masquerade

Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and Silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
How we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
I could stay up all night
Keep flipping up the eyes, oh
I'm walking on the line
But baby, I don't mind

'Cause ooh, you get my heart rate up
Temperature go to the top
When you (push the button, push the button)
Ooh, there's something in the way
That you laid your eyes on me
Yeah, you do

But I can't wait till you get closer
You make it look like it's supposed to
And if you're hotter than Miami
Then baby, I'mma lay down

All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh, push, push, push, push
All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh-ooh, push, push, push

(Ahh-ah)
My mind keeps going down
(Down)
I guess I'm not the only one
But you got it right
A sublime amount of high
Got me losing track of time
But I, I, I don't mind

You get my heart rate up
Temperature go to the top
When you (push the button, push the button)
Ooh, there's something in the way
That you laid your eyes on me
Yeah, you do
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

But I can't wait till you get closer
You make it look like it's supposed to
And if you're hotter than Miami

Push, push, push
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Leaving you was easy to say
Harder on me every day
Places I keep stumblin' into you
All you were was a sweet escape
With a bitter aftertaste
Only got myself to blame

I get high, every Friday
Waste my time, every Sunday
Bottle of wine on a Monday
I just keep on spiraling down

Shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I do I can't keep you and keep me too
Say shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I see you still remain a part of me
Say shame on me

Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Losing me was the first mistake
Wished there was a pill to take
'Cause I still see you in every face
Try to shake you off like a Polaroid
Subconsciously paranoid
Only got myself to blame

I get wild every Friday
Low on life on a Sunday
I just can't get out of my way, I try
But I just keep on spiralin' down

Shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I do
I can't keep you and keep me too
Say shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I see
You still remain a part of me
Say shame on me

Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

You're still there
Like a pounding in my head
And it keeps on coming back
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
You're still there
And I'm still calling out you're name
I'm the only one to blame
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on me
Oh-oh ah-ah
No matter what I do
I can't keep you and keep me too

Say shame on me
Oh-oh ah-ah, say shame on me
Shame on me, no, no, no
Uh, uh-uh
No, no, no, no, no
Shame on me
Uh, uh-uh
Shame on me
No, no, no, no

The energy, it's coming from inside
(Inside, baby)
It's like a secret that you can't explore
You're gonna keep on trying all your life
(Life)

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

It keeps you out
There's no doubt
Attention
It pushed you to the limit and beyond
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
It is stuck inside your mind
Your body
Everywhere else you do not know
(How can you know, know, know)
If you are trying to push it away
It's gonna stay
A life long

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

Is electronic so hypnotic
Don't try to get rid of it
Come out is automatic
Keeping your whole brain in synch
Automatic, so pathetic
Keeping you all day ecstatic
Supersonic can't control

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic....

Tell me it's a nightmare
And you ain't going nowhere
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price

Should've seen it coming, baby
Should've seen it in my eyes
It's not like I never told ya
Shouldn't come as a surprise
You were high on the adrenaline
And you always wanted more
I'm a demon in the shadows
And you stepped into the dark

I confess this, I can't stop
I'm possessive, I chew you up
You took everything I gave ya
But you always wanted more
(Be careful what you wish for)

(Woo-ah!)
The time is passing fast and there is
No way to get it back because it's
High speed, it goes around and doesn't
Even do a sound and there is
No time to catch a breath and
When it's gone it's lost in space and there is
Nothing to make me stop
I wanna get in love

Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head

Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All of our dreams (all of our dreams)
All of the things (all of the things)
We should've done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

We thought we last forever but
Pushing set and never rest and there is
Anger for everything
And there is no chance to win
Into the way, all the place
Are we really lost a stance?
What's right and what is wrong?
Now all we've done is on

It change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head

Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All of our dreams (all of our dreams)
All of the things (all of the things)
We should've done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

I was going on (on and on)
Running on and on (on and on)
It will never stop (never stop)
It will never stop (never stop)
There's no time to breathe (time to breathe)
Back and fall asleep (fall asleep)
It's running on and on (on and on)
Time

Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)

Running, running on and on, it's running on and on
And it will never stop, it will never stop
The time, more time, more time, more time
Oh, oh
Hi-hats tickin', make them boys roll up
They'll be humpin' on my double dutch bus
I keep 'em bumpin' on this brand new beat
Ain't never met a motherfucker fresh like me, yeah

I drop it low on the daily baby
Anticipating till I pass the dulce
They tippy-toein', doin' jumpin' jacks
Them boys be dreamin' of a rack like that

Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

Sorry, didn't mean to lead you on
Too many players on my playground
I guess he likes my personality
'Cause his knees be shakin' like a tambourine


Oh, he had a taste of my swing-set glory
A man-to-baby transformation story
He's tippy-toin' on the finish line
Say, say are you ready for my exercise?

Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face

Woo-ah!
Midnight under moonlight
Chills down your spine, fear in your eyes
Feelin' malicious, heard you like it vicious
All your dirty wishes, we were made to do it

Come on, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Hot stuff, know you like it rough
When I put it on ya, you'll never get enough
Feelin' the pressure, the pain turns into pleasure
Ooh, I'm gonna get ya, ooh, I'm gonna get ya

Come on, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh

Only in the darkness will you find your true self
Howl at the moon to awaken the spell
One cannot judge what the eye cannot see
Outside the realm of humanity
Embrace your fear, don't dare to run
Only then will you be what you're meant to become

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Come dance with me all night, all night

Tell me why I wonder, wonder why
Since I know you
I think bout your body every day
'Cuz everything seems so picture perfect
My heart was broken by another guy

What can you dream
When your dreams come true?
Since I am with you, I lost the view
Will I ever become the one for you?

No matter what I do
I'm in love with you
(Come dance with me all night, all night)

Your kiss tasted bittersweet

What can you dream
When your dreams come true?
Since I am with you, I lost the view
Will I ever become the one for you?

No matter what I do
I'm in love with you
(Come dance with me all night, all night)


(Come dance with me all night, all night)

You know you want some of that
We 'bout to, we 'bout to dip

I, I don't know why
You can make me feel
Like everything I do is never enough
Yeah I, I try to change
I just can't get it right
But you know that I try with all that I got

And I've tried to be what you want me to be
But I can't do it
Try to sugarcoat how it feels
'Cause what is to it?
And it makes no sense to me
That you gotta make me feel so small
You call it out in one, two, three

Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to

I, I don't know why
You can talk me down
And make what I say sound so insecure
Inside, I'm screaming out
You put me in a box
But still I can't stop to reach out for more

And I've tried to change what you want me to change
But I can't do it
And it makes no sense to me

Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

I'm not like you

And I don't want to

Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
Thought that you were the exception
Took a fatal blow to my heart
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you

Wish I could forget ya, like I never met ya
Said you wanna break, then you broke my heart
You left me with nothing, I feel like I'm drowning
You just let me down and I don't know why
Wish that I could say that you're dead to me
What's it gonna take to feel alive again?
I feel like I'm breaking, I keep medicating
I just can't believe that it's over now

All I do is cry about you
All I do is cry
You're always in my head
Feels like I'm living dead
Remember when you said that this would never end?

Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

You made a potion and I gave it a taste
In slow motion you showed another face
Every word you whisper, demons in my head
Babe, you have me beat and it's killing me

You play your cards and the weather is raging
You're rearranging the storms we're exchanging
Put your spell on me, on me

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared
I declare bittersweet surrender

Chilling shivers running up my spine
Words that echo when I call you mine, woo
And everything you promised that you never did
Take the pain away while I fade to gray

You play your cards and the weather is raging
You're rearranging the storms we're exchanging
Put your spell on me, on me

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared

You don't even know what you did to me
Tears fall like rain, man
You broke my heart baby, literally
I just can't take it
Couldn't eat, sleep for days
And my mind going four ways
Bottle of Jack half-empty
In and out of bed, sitting in the hallway
You don't know the tears that I cried
You don't want to see my dark side
And my mind going psycho
Hated that you wasted my time
Friends thought I was insane
Almost tatted your name
Ask God to do to you what you did to me
At night when I pray

I used to do it all for you
I used to give it all to you

You made it hurt too much
Hope you got, hope you got
Everything you want
Pray to God, pray to God (Pray to God, baby)

Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

Every day I hope you're broken-hearted (Hearted)
Every night I hope you're broken-hearted (Hearted)
Every day I hope you're broken-hearted (Hearted)
Yeah, broken-hearted (Hearted)
Woo-ah!

Do anything to keep you near
Count imperfections in the mirror

So I kill my insecurities

Every time she goes through her hair
I feel the tension in the air
No, I can’t let you leave
So I kill my insecurities

Oh, you can’t do better

Do anything that it could take
Convince myself I’m in first place

In an alternate reality

Tried to be sweet, tried to be fun
No, I can’t let you leave
No, it’s not a possibility

It's you and me
And no one else here
Nothing will stay the same

Because you were never here, never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you see I really want to stay with you
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something?
It's there, it's there, it's there

There's something in the air
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel it
One day is not enough
I'm asking you, can you feel it?

Without you only
Now I'm back in your arms
Stay tonight
I'll do what you like
I will do you no harm

Because you're never here or never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you tell I really want you to stay with me
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something
It's there, it's there, it's there

Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
In the air

There's a beat coming up
And it's suddenly hurting you
If you ever get you here
Notice, I won't be your hidden affair
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

I been out West in LA, and shit
All my exes want attention, I ain't payin' it
I ain't spent a thing off my latest check
Funny thing we ain't even in a relationship
Hallucinogenic
Don't know how long I been trippin'
But I'm sippin' and I'm kickin' it with you
It's been a lot of fun
Puffin', puffin', passin'
We made love, we made it happen
We got passion
We did things you probably hadn't even thought of yet

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze, and it feels so good

If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

I been out West in LA, and shit
Smoking things, chasing dreams
On some player shit
Thinking I might buy a chain with my latest flip
You just gotta run your feet
I'm running through the check
Player hating on me 'cause she told me she was single
But you see just how I'm rocking and you couldn't really blame him
We was puffin', puffin', passin'
We was fuckin', we was laughin'
We had passion
We was doing things that you couldn't even imagine, yeah

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze and it feels so good

If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

You can hit me, you can hit me
Yeah, you know where I'm at
(Where I'm at, where I'm at, I gotcha)
And I wanna, and I wanna make sure you won't forget
(Won't forget, won't forget, I gotcha)
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
Every time that we hang
(That we hang, that we hang, I gotcha)
Pass it over, pass it over
Do it over again, do it over again, do it over again


If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills, yeah
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

And I'll never, I'll never forget that

Missed you real bad when I went to California
I got so excited when I seen you in the hallway

I ain't got the time to buy a new heart of mine

Oh, I think about if you think about me (Woo-ah!)
Circle right down when you're not around me (Woo-ah!)
And I lie each time when I say I don't need (You-ah!)
'Cause I think about if you think about me

Da-da-da
Da-da-da
(Time is money)

Circle right down when you're not around me (Woo-ah!)
And I lie each time when I say I don't need, don't need (You-ah!)
'Cause I think about if you think about me

Time is money
Time is money
Woo-ah!
So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Nobody's got the perfect rhyme
The perfect steps, the perfect lines
So what? We keep it rocking, eh
Nobody's stopping for this
You take a shot, the final show
You leave 'em clapping when you go through this
Whatever happens, hey
It doesn't matter for shit, yeah

'Cause no one knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancing to this
With a drink in my hand, a dream in my sights
But we can put it off until tomorrow night

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

They tell you lies, a losing game
A dead end road with no escape, fuck that!
Long as we're ticking
Might as well go out with a bang, yeah

'Cause no one knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancing to this
With a drink in my hand, down for the night
And they'll be poppin' bottles in the afterlife

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Hey, go, where you wanna go
Say what you wanna say, ay-ay
Say whatever you wanna say, yeah
Hey, go, where you wanna go
Say what you wanna say, ay-ay
Hey, oh, oh, yeah

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Hey, go, where you wanna go
Say what you wanna
Till all my dreams are done
Yeah, I'll be dancing
First time in my life I, I'm not afraid
First time I remember feeling anything, anything
There's no turning back now, I can't be saved
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

I'm the greatest God created
I'm a sickness, I'm contagious
I'm a demon, power trippin'
On a mission, and vindictive
Suffocating, exterminating
And I love it, every second
Full of hatred, irritated
Cut you open for entertainment

Ooh
They'll remember me
Ooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
First time I remember feeling anything, anything (anything)
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back)

And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

Deine Zeit ist abgelaufen
Ich bin dein Alptraum, Ich bin dein Omen
Wenn du mich siehst, fängst du besser an zu laufen
Kannst du glauben!
Sag jetzt deine letzten Worte
Ich krieg' immer was ich wollte
Ich bin das Ende deiner Tage
Ich bin die Krankheit, ich bin die Plage

Ooh
They'll remember me
Ooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
First time I remember feeling anything, anything (anything)
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back)
I can't be saved (I can't be saved)
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

Feels like I'm losing my direction

Imagination no reality
If I stay too long, this pain inside my head
But if I leave I'm missing it too bad
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Is this magnetism that I'm holding on
Feels like I'm losing my direction
Are you magnetic?

Hold me closer with your energy
I am searching for my gravity
Are you magnetic?

Forget your darkest hour and all your pain

Everybody's looking at their telephone
It's only about the good looks
'Bout your clothes, your car, and your neighborhood
Some people only look like gold
Well, that is only till the truth unfolds

But I wanna be free of this
I'm not a piece of plastic
They say live and let live
But no one acts like it
I put on my mask again
Can't let them see who I am, who I am

Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
Said I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
Yeah we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic

I get up, get up one more time
I look in the mirror, put on a smile
Everybody always looks so mad
Is it my fault that you are depressed?
He said he's gonna put my record out
But only if I take my clothes off now
Where have all these values gone
Now everybody is replaceable

But I wanna be free of this
I'm not a piece of plastic
They say live and let live
But no one acts like it
I put on my mask again
Can't let them see who I am, who I am

Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
Said I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
How we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic

So what they say?
Fake it till you make it
Shake it till you break it
Move ya money maker up and down
Nobody cares about what's inside
As long as you make that booty go round
Cause real quick you'll be called a bitch
Cause you break somebody's heart
So you gotta make the best of it
Grab a bottle drink it up

Okay
I got a heart
I got a brain
I got a life
It's half insane
But I don't care
Bout what they say
I'm gonna stop my masquerade
My masquerade

Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and Silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
How we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
I could stay up all night
Keep flipping up the eyes, oh
I'm walking on the line
But baby, I don't mind

'Cause ooh, you get my heart rate up
Temperature go to the top
When you (push the button, push the button)
Ooh, there's something in the way
That you laid your eyes on me
Yeah, you do

But I can't wait till you get closer
You make it look like it's supposed to
And if you're hotter than Miami
Then baby, I'mma lay down
I'mma lay down, I'mma lay down

All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh, push, push, push, push
All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh-ooh, push, push, push

(Ahh-ah)
My mind keeps going down
(Down)
I guess I'm not the only one
But you got it right
A sublime amount of high
Got me losing track of time
But I, I, I don't mind

You get my heart rate up
Temperature go to the top
When you (push the button, push the button)
Ooh, there's something in the way
That you laid your eyes on me
Yeah, you do
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

But I can't wait till you get closer
You make it look like it's supposed to
And if you're hotter than Miami
Then baby, I'mma lay down

All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh, push, push, push, push
All you got to do

Ooh-ooh, yeah, push, push, push


But I can't wait till you get closer
You make it look like it's supposed to
And if you're hotter than Miami
Then baby, I'mma lay down
I'mma lay down, I'mma lay down

All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh, push, push, push, push

All you gotta do, ooh
Push, push, push
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Leaving you was easy to say
Harder on me every day
Places I keep stumblin' into you
All you were was a sweet escape
With a bitter aftertaste
Only got myself to blame

I get high, every Friday
Waste my time, every Sunday
Bottle of wine on a Monday
I just keep on spiraling down

Shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I do I can't keep you and keep me too
Say shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I see you still remain a part of me
Say shame on me

Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Losing me was the first mistake
Wished there was a pill to take
'Cause I still see you in every face
Try to shake you off like a Polaroid
Subconsciously paranoid
Only got myself to blame

I get wild every Friday
Low on life on a Sunday
I just can't get out of my way, I try
But I just keep on spiralin' down

Shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I do
I can't keep you and keep me too
Say shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I see
You still remain a part of me
Say shame on me

Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

You're still there
Like a pounding in my head
And it keeps on coming back
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
You're still there
And I'm still calling out you're name
I'm the only one to blame
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on me
Oh-oh ah-ah
No matter what I do
I can't keep you and keep me too

Say shame on me
Oh-oh ah-ah, say shame on me
Shame on me, no, no, no
Uh, uh-uh
No, no, no, no, no
Shame on me
Uh, uh-uh
Shame on me
No, no, no, no

(Inside, baby)
It's like a secret that you can't explore
You're gonna keep on trying all your life
(Life)

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

It keeps you out
There's no doubt
Attention
It pushed you to the limit and beyond
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
It is stuck inside your mind
Your body
Everywhere else you do not know
(How can you know, know, know)
If you are trying to push it away
It's gonna stay
A life long

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

Don't try to get rid of it
Come out is automatic
Keeping your whole brain in synch
Automatic, so pathetic
Keeping you all day ecstatic
Supersonic can't control

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic....

Tell me it's a nightmare
And you ain't going nowhere
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price

Should've seen it coming, baby
Should've seen it in my eyes
It's not like I never told ya
Shouldn't come as a surprise
You were high on the adrenaline
And you always wanted more
I'm a demon in the shadows
And you stepped into the dark

I confess this, I can't stop
I'm possessive, I chew you up
You took everything I gave ya
But you always wanted more
(Be careful what you wish for)

Tell me how we got here

And you ain't going nowhere (And you ain't going nowhere)
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price, yeah

(Woo-ah!)
The time is passing fast and there is
No way to get it back because it's
High speed, it goes around and doesn't
Even do a sound and there is
No time to catch a breath and
When it's gone it's lost in space and there is
Nothing to make me stop
I wanna get in love

Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head

Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All of our dreams (all of our dreams)
All of the things (all of the things)
We should've done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

We thought we last forever but
Pushing set and never rest and there is
Anger for everything
And there is no chance to win
Into the way, all the place
Are we really lost a stance?
What's right and what is wrong?
Now all we've done is on

It change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head

Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)

Running on and on (on and on)
It will never stop (never stop)
It will never stop (never stop)
There's no time to breathe (time to breathe)
Back and fall asleep (fall asleep)
It's running on and on (on and on)
Time

Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)

Oh, oh
Hi-hats tickin', make them boys roll up
They'll be humpin' on my double dutch bus
I keep 'em bumpin' on this brand new beat
Ain't never met a motherfucker fresh like me, yeah

I drop it low on the daily baby
Anticipating till I pass the dulce
They tippy-toein', doin' jumpin' jacks
Them boys be dreamin' of a rack like that

Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

Sorry, didn't mean to lead you on
Too many players on my playground
I guess he likes my personality
'Cause his knees be shakin' like a tambourine


Oh, he had a taste of my swing-set glory
A man-to-baby transformation story
He's tippy-toin' on the finish line
Say, say are you ready for my exercise?

Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline

Woo-ah!
Midnight under moonlight
Chills down your spine, fear in your eyes
Feelin' malicious, heard you like it vicious
All your dirty wishes, we were made to do it

Come on, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Hot stuff, know you like it rough
When I put it on ya, you'll never get enough
Feelin' the pressure, the pain turns into pleasure
Ooh, I'm gonna get ya, ooh, I'm gonna get ya

Come on, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh

Only in the darkness will you find your true self
Howl at the moon to awaken the spell
One cannot judge what the eye cannot see
Outside the realm of humanity
Embrace your fear, don't dare to run
Only then will you be what you're meant to become

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh

I, I don't know why
You can make me feel
Like everything I do is never enough
Yeah I, I try to change
I just can't get it right
But you know that I try with all that I got

And I've tried to be what you want me to be
But I can't do it
Try to sugarcoat how it feels
'Cause what is to it?
And it makes no sense to me
That you gotta make me feel so small
You call it out in one, two, three

Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to

I, I don't know why
You can talk me down
And make what I say sound so insecure
Inside, I'm screaming out
You put me in a box
But still I can't stop to reach out for more

And I've tried to change what you want me to change
But I can't do it
And it makes no sense to me

Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to

Call me whatever
Your words don't mean a thing
Call me whatever
I'll find another dream
Call me whatever
Your words don't mean a thing
Call me an alien
Call me an alien

Yeah, just go and scream it out
Maybe it's a wrong place I'm in
And I'm from oblivion
My head's up in the clouds
You can call me an alien
Call me an alien

I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
And I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to
I need you more than air
I see you everywhere
Nobody else compares
I don't go anywhere

Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
Thought that you were the exception
Took a fatal blow to my heart
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you

Wish I could forget ya, like I never met ya
Said you wanna break, then you broke my heart
You left me with nothing, I feel like I'm drowning
You just let me down and I don't know why
Wish that I could say that you're dead to me
What's it gonna take to feel alive again?
I feel like I'm breaking, I keep medicating
I just can't believe that it's over now

All I do is cry about you
All I do is cry
You're always in my head
Feels like I'm living dead
Remember when you said that this would never end?

Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
Thought that you were the exception
Took a fatal blow to my heart
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you (All I do is cry about you)

Wish I could forget ya, like I never met ya
Said you wanna break, then you broke my heart
You left me with nothing, I feel like I'm drowning
You just let me down and I don't know why
Wish that I could say that you're dead to me

All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you
I just wanna do it everyday
All the time, a-all the time
I just wanna do it every night
All the time, a-all the time
Yeah

Didn't plan to go and catch another feelin'
But it hit me up like it was lightning

You made a potion and I gave it a taste
In slow motion you showed another face
Every word you whisper, demons in my head
Babe, you have me beat and it's killing me

You play your cards and the weather is raging
You're rearranging the storms we're exchanging
Put your spell on me, on me

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared
I declare bittersweet surrender

Chilling shivers running up my spine
Words that echo when I call you mine, woo
And everything you promised that you never did
Take the pain away while I fade to gray

You play your cards and the weather is raging
You're rearranging the storms we're exchanging
Put your spell on me, on me

So I throw my flag up
Let it rain
Lock me up in your touch
I'm unchained
Won't you come and lay it all on me?
Take me to the peak
Baby I, I'm not scared
I declare bittersweet surrender

You're like a devil in disguise

Hunt me down, I'm yours to take
Baby, captivate me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, ooh

You don't even know what you did to me
Tears fall like rain, man
You broke my heart baby, literally
I just can't take it
Couldn't eat, sleep for days
And my mind going four ways
Bottle of Jack half-empty
In and out of bed, sitting in the hallway
You don't know the tears that I cried
You don't want to see my dark side
And my mind going psycho
Hated that you wasted my time
Friends thought I was insane
Almost tatted your name
Ask God to do to you what you did to me
At night when I pray

I used to do it all for you
I used to give it all to you

You made it hurt too much
Hope you got, hope you got
Everything you want
Pray to God, pray to God (Pray to God, baby)
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)
So much for the love
Hope she got, hope she got (Hope she got everything I'm not)
Everything I'm not
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

Every day I hope you're broken-hearted (Hearted)
Every night I hope you're broken-hearted (Hearted)
Every day I hope you're broken-hearted (Hearted)
Yeah, broken-hearted (Hearted)
Woo-ah!

Every time she goes through her hair
I feel the tension in the air

Convince myself I’m in first place

Tried to be sweet, tried to be fun

This night, this beauty
The stars around me
Nothing more I could say
It's you and me
And no one else here
Nothing will stay the same

Because you were never here, never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you see I really want to stay with you
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something?
It's there, it's there, it's there

There's something in the air
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel it
One day is not enough
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel the rush

Na-na na na na na...

I felt so lonely
Without you only
Now I'm back in your arms
Stay tonight
I'll do what you like
I will do you no harm

Because you're never here or never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you tell I really want you to stay with me
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something
It's there, it's there, it's there

Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
In the air

There's something in the air
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel it
One day is not enough
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel the rush
Feel the touch
Wait up 'til dawn and see those thoughts
I'm asking you
Wish you can stay the night
I'm wanting you to feel it
I can feel it, feel it, feel

Na-na na na na na....

There's a beat coming up
And it's suddenly hurting you
If you ever get you here
Notice, I won't be your hidden affair
If you wanna pop one in the hills

Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

I been out West in LA, and shit
All my exes want attention, I ain't payin' it
I ain't spent a thing off my latest check
Funny thing we ain't even in a relationship
Hallucinogenic
Don't know how long I been trippin'
But I'm sippin' and I'm kickin' it with you
It's been a lot of fun
Puffin', puffin', passin'
We made love, we made it happen
We got passion
We did things you probably hadn't even thought of yet

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze, and it feels so good

If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

I been out West in LA, and shit
Smoking things, chasing dreams
On some player shit
Thinking I might buy a chain with my latest flip
You just gotta run your feet
I'm running through the check
Player hating on me 'cause she told me she was single
But you see just how I'm rocking and you couldn't really blame him
We was puffin', puffin', passin'
We was fuckin', we was laughin'
We had passion
We was doing things that you couldn't even imagine, yeah

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze and it feels so good

If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down

Yeah, you know where I'm at
(Where I'm at, where I'm at, I gotcha)
And I wanna, and I wanna make sure you won't forget
(Won't forget, won't forget, I gotcha)
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
Every time that we hang
(That we hang, that we hang, I gotcha)
Pass it over, pass it over
Do it over again, do it over again, do it over again


If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills, yeah
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down

And I'll never, I'll never forget that

'Member when we traded my Louis in for two ounce
Missed you real bad when I went to California
I got so excited when I seen you in the hallway
I remember when you said we'd make it both together
I remember when you said you're comin' in December
Out of luck, must be out of luck 'cause you're not here

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Nobody's got the perfect rhyme
The perfect steps, the perfect lines
So what? We keep it rocking, eh
Nobody's stopping for this
You take a shot, the final show
You leave 'em clapping when you go through this
Whatever happens, hey
It doesn't matter for shit, yeah

'Cause no one knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancing to this
With a drink in my hand, a dream in my sights
But we can put it off until tomorrow night

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

They tell you lies, a losing game
A dead end road with no escape, fuck that!
Long as we're ticking
Might as well go out with a bang, yeah

'Cause no one knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancing to this
With a drink in my hand, down for the night
And they'll be poppin' bottles in the afterlife

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell

'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Hey, go, where you wanna go
Say what you wanna
Till all my dreams are done
Yeah, I'll be dancing
First time in my life I, I'm not afraid
First time I remember feeling anything, anything
There's no turning back now, I can't be saved
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

I'm the greatest God created
I'm a sickness, I'm contagious
I'm a demon, power trippin'
On a mission, and vindictive
Suffocating, exterminating
And I love it, every second
Full of hatred, irritated
Cut you open for entertainment

Ooh
They'll remember me
Ooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
First time I remember feeling anything, anything (anything)
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back)
I can't be saved (I can't be saved)
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

Deine Zeit ist abgelaufen
Ich bin dein Alptraum, Ich bin dein Omen
Wenn du mich siehst, fängst du besser an zu laufen
Kannst du glauben!
Sag jetzt deine letzten Worte
Ich krieg' immer was ich wollte
Ich bin das Ende deiner Tage
Ich bin die Krankheit, ich bin die Plage

Ooh
They'll remember me
Ooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
First time I remember feeling anything, anything (anything)
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back)
I can't be saved (I can't be saved)
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

Woah, woah, woah, woah

Feels like I'm losing my direction
Are you magnetic?

Of a brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Hey, brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye

'cause every way is hard
There is no imitation of everybody's heart
There are no limits, and no boundaries
So why you want to tell me my love is a disease

One million voices
Come only once
And every little step
Comes the rolling stone

Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day

Don't try to tell me secrets
So you can hear mine
It is my life, I'm gonna live it right
Time is chasing me and every one of us
And when the clock stops tickin'
Then I can hear your heart

Forget your darkest hour and all your pain
'Cause I can see the sun after the rain

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye

Everybody's looking at their telephone
It's only about the good looks
'Bout your clothes, your car, and your neighborhood
Some people only look like gold
Well, that is only till the truth unfolds

But I wanna be free of this
I'm not a piece of plastic
They say live and let live
But no one acts like it
I put on my mask again
Can't let them see who I am, who I am

Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
Said I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
Yeah we act like plastic, plastic

Is it my fault that you are depressed?
He said he's gonna put my record out
But only if I take my clothes off now
Where have all these values gone
Now everybody is replaceable

But I wanna be free of this
I'm not a piece of plastic
They say live and let live
But no one acts like it
I put on my mask again
Can't let them see who I am, who I am

Cause I was born in the age of party and porn
Bleached blondes and silicone
But I'm looking for something real
In this plastic factory
Said I was born in the age of money and fame
Where love is just a game
But I'm looking for something real

So we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic
How we act like plastic, plastic
Isn't it fantastic, tastic

So what they say?
Fake it till you make it
Shake it till you break it
Move ya money maker up and down
Nobody cares about what's inside
As long as you make that booty go round
Cause real quick you'll be called a bitch
Cause you break somebody's heart
So you gotta make the best of it
Grab a bottle drink it up

Okay

My masquerade

You make it look like it's supposed to
And if you're hotter than Miami
Then baby, I'mma lay down
I'mma lay down, I'mma lay down

All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh, push, push, push, push
All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh-ooh, yeah, push, push, push
All you gotta do is

All you gotta do, eh
All you gotta do, ooh
Push, push, push
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Leaving you was easy to say
Harder on me every day
Places I keep stumblin' into you
All you were was a sweet escape
With a bitter aftertaste
Only got myself to blame

I get high, every Friday
Waste my time, every Sunday
Bottle of wine on a Monday
I just keep on spiraling down

Shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I do I can't keep you and keep me too
Say shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I see you still remain a part of me
Say shame on me

Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Losing me was the first mistake
Wished there was a pill to take
'Cause I still see you in every face
Try to shake you off like a Polaroid
Subconsciously paranoid
Only got myself to blame

I get wild every Friday
Low on life on a Sunday
I just can't get out of my way, I try
But I just keep on spiralin' down

Shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I do
I can't keep you and keep me too
Say shame on me, oh-oh, ah-ah
No matter what I see
You still remain a part of me
Say shame on me

Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Oo, oo
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

You're still there
Like a pounding in my head
And it keeps on coming back
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
You're still there
And I'm still calling out you're name
I'm the only one to blame
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on me
Oh-oh ah-ah
No matter what I do
I can't keep you and keep me too

Say shame on me
Oh-oh ah-ah, say shame on me
Shame on me, no, no, no
Uh, uh-uh
No, no, no, no, no
Shame on me
Uh, uh-uh
Shame on me
No, no, no, no

Excitement mixed with energy and light

It's like a bubble that's about to pop
The energy, it's coming from inside
(Inside, baby)
It's like a secret that you can't explore
You're gonna keep on trying all your life
(Life)

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

It keeps you out
There's no doubt
Attention
It pushed you to the limit and beyond
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
It is stuck inside your mind
Your body
Everywhere else you do not know
(How can you know, know, know)
If you are trying to push it away
It's gonna stay
A life long

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

Is electronic so hypnotic
Don't try to get rid of it
Come out is automatic
Keeping your whole brain in synch
Automatic, so pathetic
Keeping you all day ecstatic
Supersonic can't control

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic....

Tell me how we got here
I see you but you're not there
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price
Tell me it's a nightmare
And you ain't going nowhere
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price

Should've seen it coming, baby
Should've seen it in my eyes
It's not like I never told ya
Shouldn't come as a surprise
You were high on the adrenaline
And you always wanted more
I'm a demon in the shadows
And you stepped into the dark

I confess this, I can't stop
I'm possessive, I chew you up
You took everything I gave ya
But you always wanted more
(Be careful what you wish for)

Tell me how we got here

Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price
Tell me it's a nightmare (Tell me it's a nightmare)
And you ain't going nowhere (And you ain't going nowhere)
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price, yeah

It's running through my veins
And it's everything I touch
Be careful when you love me
I'm only out for blood
You know I'd be the end of you
But you always wanted more

(Woo-ah!)
The time is passing fast and there is
No way to get it back because it's
High speed, it goes around and doesn't
Even do a sound and there is
No time to catch a breath and
When it's gone it's lost in space and there is
Nothing to make me stop
I wanna get in love

Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head

Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All of our dreams (all of our dreams)
All of the things (all of the things)
We should've done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

We thought we last forever but
Pushing set and never rest and there is
Anger for everything
And there is no chance to win
Into the way, all the place
Are we really lost a stance?
What's right and what is wrong?
Now all we've done is on

It change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases around your head

Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All of our dreams (all of our dreams)
All of the things (all of the things)
We should've done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

I was going on (on and on)
Running on and on (on and on)
It will never stop (never stop)
It will never stop (never stop)
There's no time to breathe (time to breathe)
Back and fall asleep (fall asleep)
It's running on and on (on and on)
Time

Even if time (even if time)
Tears us apart (tears us apart)
We have a life we never knew we would
And there'll be a place (there'll be a place)
So we're lost in space (so lost in space)
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All of our dreams (all of our dreams)
All of the things (all of the things)
We should've done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

Running, running on and on, it's running on and on
And it will never stop, it will never stop
The time, more time, more time, more time
Oh, oh
Hi-hats tickin', make them boys roll up
They'll be humpin' on my double dutch bus
I keep 'em bumpin' on this brand new beat
Ain't never met a motherfucker fresh like me, yeah

I drop it low on the daily baby
Anticipating till I pass the dulce
They tippy-toein', doin' jumpin' jacks
Them boys be dreamin' of a rack like that

Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

Sorry, didn't mean to lead you on
Too many players on my playground
I guess he likes my personality
'Cause his knees be shakin' like a tambourine


Oh, he had a taste of my swing-set glory
A man-to-baby transformation story
He's tippy-toin' on the finish line
Say, say are you ready for my exercise?

Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face

Woo-ah!
Midnight under moonlight
Chills down your spine, fear in your eyes
Feelin' malicious, heard you like it vicious
All your dirty wishes, we were made to do it

Come on, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Hot stuff, know you like it rough
When I put it on ya, you'll never get enough
Feelin' the pressure, the pain turns into pleasure
Ooh, I'm gonna get ya, ooh, I'm gonna get ya

Come on, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh

Only in the darkness will you find your true self
Howl at the moon to awaken the spell
One cannot judge what the eye cannot see
Outside the realm of humanity
Embrace your fear, don't dare to run
Only then will you be what you're meant to become

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
