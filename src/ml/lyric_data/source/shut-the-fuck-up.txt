[Verse 1]
Uh, he kept on knocking
I was drunk and he wanted some
He keeps on mumbling
He's always fucking mumbling so
I took her to the dude across the street
He said, "Hi, how ya doing? Wanna kick it with me?", yeah
He's reminiscing, didn't even listen, oh well
This conversation, damn this is my personal hell, ah
It always ends up this way

[Chorus]
That's why I keep saying
Shut the fuck up and give me the cash
Shut the fuck up, fuck up, and give me the cash
That's what I said
Shut the fuck up and give me the cash
Shut the fuck up and give me the cash
That's what I said
That's what I said

[Verse 2]
He come on over, he put the hand on the junk
He tell me, "Baby give me some of that banana pecan"
And he's hot for bugging
Did you bump your head or something?
That's when my phone come in handy, ring-a-ding-eh-sorry
I gots to go but where I going ain't ya biz
Cause I, I don't need love, I don't need love
I don't care whatcha saying, I'm just playing baby


[Chorus]
That's why I keep saying
Shut the fuck up and give me the cash
Shut the fuck up, fuck up, and give me the cash
That's what I said
Shut the fuck up and give me the cash
Shut the fuck up and give me the cash
That's what I said
That's what I said

[Bridge]
Benji, Benji, Benji, the only one I love
Benji, Benji, Benji, say I never give you up

[Chorus]
That's why I keep saying
Shut the fuck up and give me the cash
Shut the fuck up, fuck up, and give me the cash
That's what I said
Shut the fuck up and give me the cash
Shut the fuck up and give me the cash
That's what I said
That's what I said
