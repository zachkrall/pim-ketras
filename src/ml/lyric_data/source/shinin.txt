[Chorus]
From the bottom, you come up
From haters to lovers
From nada to Prada, you know you're a star
You are shinin', lit as a diamond
From dollar to baller
You know you're a star, you are

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, sometimes
You gotta jump through fences with the barbed wire
You wanna wave the white flag for the hard times
You're just a little unprepared for the long ride
But that's fine, that's fine
Smoke Bob Marley, everything gon' be alright
Rollie said it's our time and that's no lie
We shine on 'em so bright even at night

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're lost, don't get down, don't give up now
You should know just what you are

[Chorus]
From the bottom, you come up
From haters to lovers
From nada to Prada, you know you're a star
You are shinin', lit as a diamond
From dollar to baller
You know you're a star, you are

[Post-Chorus]
Keep shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin' on, on
Keep shinin', shinin', on-on
Keep shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin' on, on
Keep shinin', shinin', on-on

[Verse 2]
Shine, go ahead and shine
Don't dim your light for any haters, baby, make 'em blind
If they follow, they'll just meet you at the finish line
You don't need no parachute if you know how to fly, unless you fly
We're out of line (Out of line)
When they was in the club, you was on your grind (On your grind)
Your victory's so sweet, they are so alive (So alive)
You're killing it so hard, it should be a crime, should be a crime

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're lost, don't get down, don't give up now
You should know just what you are

[Chorus]
From the bottom, you come up
From haters to lovers
From nada to Prada, you know you're a star
You are shinin', lit as a diamond
From dollar to baller
You know you're a star, you are

[Post-Chorus]
Keep shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin' on, on
(Keep shinin', shinin', on)
Keep shinin', shinin', on-on
(Keep shinin')
Keep shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin' on, on
Keep shinin', shinin', on-on

[Outro]
Woo-ah!
