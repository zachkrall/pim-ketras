[Verse 1]
You only call me when you're drunk
When she is not around
When she is not around
You only want me when you're high
When I undress for you
When I'm a mess for you

[Chorus]
(She!)
She gets all your love
And I just get the dark part of your heart
(She!)
She gets all your love
And I just get the dark part of your heart
(She!)
She gets all your love
But honey, I know who you really are
(She!)
She gets all your love
All your love

[Verse 2]
Safe in my self-destructive mind
Do I bring out the worst in you
When I'm giving the best of me?
Say, is it only me that hurts?
Do you ever think of me?
When you're giving your best to her?
(To her)

[Chorus]
(She!)
She gets all your love
And I just get the dark part of your heart
(She!)
She gets all your love
And I just get the dark part of your heart
(She!)
She gets all your love
But honey, I know who you really are
(She!)
She gets all your love (your love)
All your love

[Bridge]
Yeah, if you don't need me
Why do you come by every night?
Yeah, if you don't love me
Why do you wake up by my side?
Yeah, if you don't need me
Why do you come by every night?
Yeah, if you don't love me
Why do you wake up by my side?

[Chorus]
(She!)
She gets all your love
And I just get the dark part of your heart
(She!)
She gets all your love
And I just get the dark part of your heart
(She!)
She gets all your love
But honey, I know who you really are
(She!)
She gets all your love (all your love)
All your love
All your love
All your love
