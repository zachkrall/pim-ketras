[Verse]
I lost a lot of friends and hope
I tried to stop, stop, stop
But it never, ever was enough
I tried to get him back, but I see
That it's too late, late, late
And I watched him fade

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't want it
I didn't need it
And yet repeat it
Tell me how to recognise
I didn't see it
I wanna leave it
Why did I get here?
Tell me how I lost it

[Chorus]
Tell me how I got you
Tell me what was wrong
Tell me exactly what I've done
What happened to everything I've wanted
What happened to my dreams, now are they haunted?
Tell me what I needed
Tell me what was right
Tell me about everything all night
What happened to everything I've wanted?
What happened to my dreams, now are they haunted?
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade

[Verse]
I lost a lot of friends and hope
I tried to stop, stop, stop
But it never, ever was enough
I tried to get him back, but I see
That it's too late, late, late
And I watched him fade

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't want it
I didn't need it
And yet repeat it
Tell me how to recognise
I didn't see it
I wanna leave it
Why did I get here?
Tell me how I lost it

[Chorus]
Tell me how I got you
Tell me what was wrong
Tell me exactly what I've done
What happened to everything I've wanted
What happened to my dreams, now are they haunted?
Tell me what I needed
Tell me what was right
Tell me about everything all night
What happened to everything I've wanted?
What happened to my dreams, now are they haunted?
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade

[Bridge]
I watched it all go away
Until I really got to see
I lost it all on my way
Can't it come back to me?
I wanna get back to where
Everything has been ok
I watched it all fade away, fade away
I watched him fade away

[Chorus]
Tell me how I got you
Tell me what was wrong
Tell me exactly what I've done
What happened to everything I've wanted
What happened to my dreams, now are they haunted?
Tell me what I needed
Tell me what was right
Tell me about everything all night
What happened to everything I've wanted?
What happened to my dreams, now are they haunted?
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade

[Outro]
Tell me how I got here
Tell me what was wrong
Everything I wanted
All my dreams hunted
Tell me what I needed
Tell me what was right
Everything I wanted
