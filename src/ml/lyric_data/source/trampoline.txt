[Verse 1]
Hi-hats tickin', make them boys roll up
They'll be humpin' on my double dutch bus
I keep 'em bumpin' on this brand new beat
Ain't never met a motherfucker fresh like me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I drop it low on the daily baby
Anticipating till I pass the dulce
They tippy-toein', doin' jumpin' jacks
Them boys be dreamin' of a rack like that

[Chorus]
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

[Verse 2]
Sorry, didn't mean to lead you on
Too many players on my playground
I guess he likes my personality
'Cause his knees be shakin' like a tambourine


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, he had a taste of my swing-set glory
A man-to-baby transformation story
He's tippy-toin' on the finish line
Say, say are you ready for my exercise?

[Chorus]
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face

[Bridge]
(I'm all up, up in his face)
(I'm all up, up in his face)

[Chorus]
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
Oh, I keep them bouncin' on my trampo-trampoline
Like the beat, I'm all up, up in his face
