Mess with me, you gotta mess with me
Mess with me, you gotta mess with me
Mess with me, you gotta mess with me

Mess with me, oh baby
1,2,3 got clarity
Diamonds on, no charity
This (ah!) is a rarity (oh whoa)

Mess with me, oh hunny
Mess with me, yeah

Mess with me, I'm your darling queen (yeah)
Mess with me, baby please
Mess with me

Take it up with me
I'll show who you're meant to be
But if you waste my time
You won't be mine (mine)
My heart grows like a maple tree
Cut the roots and I'll make you bleed
So don't try to mess with me (with me)
With me, with me, with me

Mess with me, oh hunny
Mess with me
Mess with me, you gotta mess with marina

Mess with me, I'm your darling queen (yeah)
Mess with me, baby please
Mess with me
Mess with me, I'm your darling queen (yeah)
Mess with me, baby please
Mess with me

Mess with me baby
Mess with me baby
Root like the trees
Mess with me baby

Woo-aah!
