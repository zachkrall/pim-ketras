Do anything to keep you near
Count imperfections in the mirror
No, I can’t let you leave
So I kill my insecurities

Every time she goes through her hair
I feel the tension in the air
No, I can’t let you leave
So I kill my insecurities

Oh, you can’t do better
Oh, you can’t do better

Do anything that it could take
Convince myself I’m in first place
And maybe you’ll pick me
In an alternate reality

Am I not built to be the one?
Tried to be sweet, tried to be fun
No, I can’t let you leave
No, it’s not a possibility

Oh, you can’t do better
Oh, you can’t do better
Don’t you know, oh
Can’t you see
That there’s no one else but me
Oh, you can’t do better

Don’t you know that you were meant for me?
Don’t you know that this is killing me?
And it’s not a possibility

Oh, you can’t do better (no baby, no baby, no)
Oh, you can’t do better (no you can’t, can’t, can’t do better)
Don’t you know, oh
Can’t you see
That there’s no one else but me
Oh, you can’t do better
You can’t do better (woo, ah!)
You can’t do better
