First time in my life I, I'm not afraid
First time I remember feeling anything, anything
There's no turning back now, I can't be saved
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

I'm the greatest God created
I'm a sickness, I'm contagious
I'm a demon, power trippin'
On a mission, and vindictive
Suffocating, exterminating
And I love it, every second
Full of hatred, irritated
Cut you open for entertainment

Ooh
They'll remember me
Ooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
First time I remember feeling anything, anything (anything)
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back)
I can't be saved (I can't be saved)
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

Deine Zeit ist abgelaufen
Ich bin dein Alptraum, Ich bin dein Omen
Wenn du mich siehst, f√§ngst du besser an zu laufen
Kannst du glauben!
Sag jetzt deine letzten Worte
Ich krieg' immer was ich wollte
Ich bin das Ende deiner Tage
Ich bin die Krankheit, ich bin die Plage

Ooh
They'll remember me
Ooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
First time I remember feeling anything, anything (anything)
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back)
I can't be saved (I can't be saved)
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me
