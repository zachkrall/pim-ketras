Oooh, do you appreciate the view?
You make me drop my cool
And take it higher than the roof
Your lips like boom
And eyes like yeah (yeah)
I like it, like the way you stare (stare)
Yeah, you could get me there
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
And I'll get to it I swear
My hips like yeah, and talk like

Can't no other do it like this
Can't no other do it like this
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't no other do it like this
Can't no other do it like this

I'mma make you scream F-I-R-E
Lose another layer 'cause I got the heat
Break the AC, break the AC (ahh-uhh)
Yeah, it's on me (uh!)

I, I'm meltin' up, oh my
I hope that you don't mind
Premium, yeah I'm prime
The top design, fresh like
Ice on the tongue, you're my professor
You can thank me later, it's on me
Yeah, it's my pleasure
Measure the weather temperature on this
Yeah, when I put it down
Then it goes somethin' like tsss

Can't no other do it like this
Can't no other do it like this
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't no other do it like this
Can't no other do it like this

I'mma make you scream F-I-R-E
Lose another layer 'cause I got the heat
Break the AC, break the AC (ahh-uhh)
Yeah, it's on me (uh!)

Do you feel the pressure?

Yeah, if you wanna
I'ma give it to ya
But don't you burn your finger on it, on it
Don't you burn your finger on it, on it, on it
But don't you burn your finger on it
But don't you burn your finger on it, on it, on it
But don't you burn your finger on it

I'mma make you scream F-I-R-E
Lose another layer 'cause I got the heat
Break the AC, break the AC (ahh-uhh)
Yeah, it's on me (uh!)

Lose another layer 'cause I got the heat
Break the AC, break the AC
(Ahh-uhh)
