You used to let me cry on your shoulder
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that
And you always let me copy your homework
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that

I remember when I left town, it was different
I don't really miss it that much, reminiscin'
Money ain't the issue, now I do what I wanna
I remember splitting my last check with you
Pick me up, used to pick me up at the corner
Tryna cop a cigarette, holes in your Impala
I didn't mean to leave you all on the back burner
I didn't think it'd happen out here, but it did (Oh, yeah)

And I wish I could spend the night, spend the night (Oh, yeah)
And I know that it's been some time, been some time

You used to let me cry on your shoulder
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that
And you always let me copy your homework
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that

So while I'm away in LA gettin' paid
Just know I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that
'Cause you drove me home when I wasn't sober
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that, no

Remember when we stayed up three days straight and passed out
'Member when we traded my Louis in for two ounce
Missed you real bad when I went to California
I got so excited when I seen you in the hallway
I remember when you said we'd make it both together
I remember when you said you're comin' in December
Out of luck, must be out of luck 'cause you're not here
Hit me up, never hit me up I waited, oh, (Oh, yeah)

And I wish you could spend the night, spend the night (Oh, yeah)
And I know that it's been some time, been some time (Yeah)

You used to let me cry on your shoulder
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that
And you always let me copy your homework
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that

So while I'm away in LA gettin' paid
Just know I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that
'Cause you drove me home when I wasn't sober (When I wasn't sober)
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that, no

Yeah I was feelin' so cool
When we rolled up before school
And sometimes I want it back
Been so busy countin' stacks
Remember how we left off
Looking back that really sucked
I know I said I would call
I know I said I would call

You used to let me cry on your shoulder
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that
And you always let me copy your homework
And I'll never, I'll never forget that (Never, never)
I'll never, I'll never forget that

So while I'm away in LA gettin' paid
Just know I'll never, I'll never forget that (Never)
I'll never, I'll never forget that
'Cause you drove me home when I wasn't sober (When I wasn't sober, yeah)
And I'll never, I'll never forget that (That)
I'll never, I'll never forget that, no
