Whatever it is that makes this feeling
It’s in everybody’s heart
It’s the moment that is so perfect
Like in a movie but better

When the moment has come
It is magic, so fun
Every question you ask
Everything is answered
It’s a dream coming true
And it happens to you
Make this moment
Last, last, last, yeah

Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Make this moment last forever
It is just a chance
Please never let it stop
It is inside your heart
Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Don’t you ever let it end

No matter who you are it happens somewhen
It is something you remember
It’s the moment that is so perfect
Nobody ever can take it away

When the moment has come
It is magic, so fun
Every question you ask
Everything is answered
It’s a dream coming true
And it happens to you
Make this moment
Last, last, last, yeah

Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Make this moment last forever
It is just a chance
Please never let it stop
It is inside your heart
Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Don’t you ever let it end

Make this moment never end
It is just a chance
In your mind and in your memory
Take it, make it
Last forever

Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
Make this moment last forever
It is just a chance
Please never let it stop
It is inside your heart
Make this moment last forever
And never let it end
