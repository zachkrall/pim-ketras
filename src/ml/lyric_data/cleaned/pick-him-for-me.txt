Key lime, there's so many flavors, many designs
Popped into my sight, you were so fly
Purple and viola shades pass by
And now you're lookin' in my eyes
In my margarita you're the spice
Tiny pink umbrella on the side, ride
You're my hot air ballon, my binocular zoom, yeah

He got all that I want
'Cause he's gonna see, so marvelously
Made it, made it easy
So I pick him for me, yeah
He got all that I want
Yeah, he's gonna see, most definitely
Made it easy, easy
So I pick him for me, yeah

Velvet, after dress rehearsal and measurements
Pins and needles showed me you're divine
Maraschino cherry patterns slide
The perfect fit, the perfect size
In my margarita you're the ice
Cinnamon and orange on the side, ride
You're my hot air ballon, my binocular zoom, yeah

He got all that I want
'Cause, he's gonna see, so marvelously
Made it, made it easy
So I pick him for me, yeah
He got all that I want
Yeah, he's gonna see, most definitely
Made it easy, easy
So I pick him for me, yeah

Tell me is my outfit on fire
Do you like my attire
'Cause I think you're so fashionable
Honeylove and Pink Nouveau
Giving me Comme des Gar√ßons
Wrapped it up like a bon bon

He got all that I want
'Cause, he's gonna see, so marvelously
Made it, made it easy
So I pick him for me, yeah
He got all that I want
Yeah, He's gonna see, most definitely
Made it easy, easy
So I pick him for me, yeah
