Tell me I'm your only when you look me in my eyes
'Cause I only do main courses, I don't do the sides
Tell me I'm the only star shinin' in the sky (Shinin' in the sky)
Tell me this is real love, say it's only us
Tell me that you need me, tell me I'm enough
Tell me everything like I'm the only one you trust (Only one you trust)

One more time, just love the way that you lie
One more time, need you to need me tonight

I don't wanna know if you're dancin' with another one
You're leavin' with another one
You're touchin' on another one
I don't wanna know if you're kissin' on another one
You're fallin' for another one
You're lovin' with another one

If I'm lit, I'ma catch a fit, be a bitch
Tell me this, baby, who you with? Who you with?
Tell me quick 'fore I start to flip like a switch
Man, I hope you ain't seeing nobody
Damn, oh, so you the man?
Baby, help me understand, tell me, what's the plan?
Are you doing it for love or just 'cause you can?
I ain't really into sharing, not for you or nobody

One more time, just love the way that you lie
One more time, need you to need me tonight

I don't wanna know if you're dancin' with another one
You're leavin' with another one
You're touchin' on another one
I don't wanna know if you're kissin' on another one
You're fallin' for another one
You're lovin' with another one

Don't you know that, don't you know that
I'm a mess since I met you?
Don't you know that, don't you know that
I've been trying to forget you?
Don't you know that all I do is cry?
Don't you know that you're the reason why?
Don't you know that, don't you know that
I'm a mess since I met you?

I don't wanna know if you're dancin' with another one
You're leavin' with another one
You're touchin' on another one
I don't wanna know if you're kissin' on another one
You're fallin' for another one
You're loving with another one (Another one)

(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
