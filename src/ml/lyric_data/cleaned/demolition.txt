There are times he puts me in the trash
Then I cry and then he wants me back
Trash me like in an ice crusher
So cold, like Russian vodka
Still I can't resist, it's so bad
You hit me with your kung fu, I get mad
Sometimes when it gets bad, I wanna go
This demolition cannot be controlled

'Cause this boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me

All the time he stabbed me in the back
A Range Rover, on a Cadillac
You are my monster, baby
Italian martini
It's like the devil in a human shell
One more kiss and I will go to hell

'Cause this boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me

Yeah, I gave you the permission
To tear my heart apart
I guess I didn't really listen
He told me from the start
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me
Demolition baby, demolish me

This boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Boy is demolition
He's got the permission to tear my heart apart
It's not a decision, boy you're demoltion
You tear my heart apart
Tear my heart apart
