Eeeh

Feel like I made it, waited all my life
Everybody rollin', tryna feel alive
Can't take it with ya, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight
Cup full of liquor, got the key to life
Came from the bottom, now my money right
Can't take it with ya, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight

Shorty in the bathroom and she asking where the coke at
I spent 20 thousand just to leave it on a coat rack
Pull up, got his number and he wrote it on a notepad
Now that's a throwback, yeah
Shinin' like I came outta the ceiling of a wraith pak
And if you ain't single, baby, know I'm tryna change that
Bet you know my name just like I came in with a name tag
'Cause I'm a name brand

Tonight, we got this, we gon' be alright (Alright, alright)
Gon' be alright
Tonight, we live like we're not gonna die (We're not gonna die)
I'm not gon' die (Yeah)

Feel like I made it, waited all my life
Everybody rollin', tryna feel alive
Can't take it with ya, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight
Cup full of liquor, got the key to life
Came from the bottom, now my money right
Can't take it with ya, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight

You got money on your mind (You should go and make it)
Got a big ol' ass behind (You should go and shake it)
These designers keep me fly (Like I'm on a spaceship)
Got me icy like a flip (Keep that Gucci on my lip)
Party live, yeah, we going worldwide (Woah, woah)
Hands high, like we tryna touch the sky (Woah, woah)
Baby, do it, you ain't even gotta try (Oh, no)
Living life, don't kill the vibe

Tonight, we got this, we gon' be alright
Yeah, we live like we're never gonna die
Never die, yeah

Feel like I made it, waited all my life
Everybody rollin', tryna feel alive
Can't take it with ya, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight
Cup full of liquor, got the key to life
Came from the bottom, now my money right (Money right)
Can't take it with ya, blow it all tonight (All tonight)
All tonight, blow it all tonight

Woo-ah!
