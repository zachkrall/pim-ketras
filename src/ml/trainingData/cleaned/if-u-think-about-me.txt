Woo-ah!

I could give you love for a minute
But don't let it get too close
'Cause I know the end and beginning
That's the way it always goes

Time is money, time is money
I ain't got the time to buy a new heart of mine, new heart of mine
Time is money, time is money
I ain't got the time to buy a new heart of mine

Oh, I think about if you think about me (Woo-ah!)
Circle right down when you're not around me (Woo-ah!)
And I lie each time when I say I don't need (You-ah!)
'Cause I think about if you think about me

I could give you love for a minute
If it's only physical
Saw it in the rear-view mirror
That is just an obstacle (Obstacle)

Time is money, time is money
I ain't got the time to buy a new heart of mine, new heart of mine
Time is money, time is money
I ain't got the time to buy a new heart of mine

Oh, I think about if you think about me (Woo-ah!)
Circle right down when you're not around me (Woo-ah!)
And I lie each time when I say I don't need (You-ah!)
'Cause I think about if you think about me

Da-da-da
Da-da-da
(Time is money)
Da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
Da-da-da
(Time is money)
Da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
Da-da-da
(Time is money)
Da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
Da-da-da
(Time is money, time is money)
Da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
But I think about

I think about if you think about me (Woo-ah!)
Circle right down when you're not around me (Woo-ah!)
And I lie each time when I say I don't need, don't need (You-ah!)
'Cause I think about if you think about me

Time is money
Time is money
Woo-ah!
