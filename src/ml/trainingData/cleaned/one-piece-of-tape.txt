If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Hey, brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Day, brand new day

There is no easy way
'cause every way is hard
There is no imitation of everybody's heart
There are no limits, and no boundaries
So why you want to tell me my love is a disease

One million voices
Come only once
And every little step
Comes the rolling stone

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day

Don't try to tell me secrets
So you can hear mine
It is my life, I'm gonna live it right
Time is chasing me and every one of us
And when the clock stops tickin'
Then I can hear your heart

Forget your darkest hour and all your pain
'Cause I can see the sun after the rain

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Hey, brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Day, brand new day

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Of a brand new day

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
