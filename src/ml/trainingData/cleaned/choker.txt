Ain't nobody know the real me
Ain't nobody but you
Can't nobody understand it
But I don't care if they do (do, do, do, do)

Yeah, how could it matter?
When it just won't get better
But you hold me together
Yeah, you hold me together

With your hands round my choker
And your hips right on mine
Say it over and over, over and over
Can't get no closer with your hips right on mine
With your hands round my choker
Over and over

Hands on my... on my
Hands on my... on my
Hands on my... on my
Hands on my... choker

Don't nobody know the pressure
Know the pressure that it take
Can't nobody measure
What you're doing to me, me

How could it matter?
When it just don't get better
You hold me together
Yeah, you hold me together

With your hands round my choker
And your hips right on mine
Say it over and over, over and over
Can't get no closer with your hips right on mine
With your hands round my choker
Over and over

Hands on my... on my
Hands on my... on my
Hands on my... on my
Hands on my... choker

No they don't understand
But it just don't get better
When I'm holding my breath
Yeah, you hold me together

With your hands round my choker
And your hips right on mine
Say it (say it) over and over, over and over
Can't get no closer with your hips right on mine
With your hands round my choker
Over and over

Hands on my... (no they don't understand)
Hands on my...
Hands on my... (but it just don't get better)
Hands on my...
Hands on my... (when I'm holding my breath)
Hands on my...
Hands on my... (yeah you hold me together)
Hands on my...
Choker
