So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Nobody's got the perfect rhyme
The perfect steps, the perfect lines
So what? We keep it rocking, eh
Nobody's stopping for this
You take a shot, the final show
You leave 'em clapping when you go through this
Whatever happens, hey
It doesn't matter for shit, yeah

'Cause no one knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancing to this
With a drink in my hand, a dream in my sights
But we can put it off until tomorrow night

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

They tell you lies, a losing game
A dead end road with no escape, fuck that!
Long as we're ticking
Might as well go out with a bang, yeah

'Cause no one knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancing to this
With a drink in my hand, down for the night
And they'll be poppin' bottles in the afterlife

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Hey, go, where you wanna go
Say what you wanna say, ay-ay
Say whatever you wanna say, yeah
Hey, go, where you wanna go
Say what you wanna say, ay-ay
Hey, oh, oh, yeah

So you rescued me from my destiny
And I'm home like a river rolling back to the sea
'Til all my dreams are done, Lord, keep me dancing
'Cause I've no one else, if I go to hell
I'll be going down laughing, just doing myself
'Til all my dreams are done, yeah, I'll be dancing

Hey, go, where you wanna go
Say what you wanna
Till all my dreams are done
Yeah, I'll be dancing
