Clarity, I got clarity
I'm the bitch with the sauce, apparently
Gave a few of y'all drip, that's charity
I ain't worried 'bout shit, you a parody
Clarity, I got clarity
VVS's 'round my neck, now they stare at me
Ain't no wonder why they all so scared of me
I'm a rarity, I got clarity

I know what I want
And I'ma go and get it, yeah
I'm a number one, yeah
I know you won't forget it
Keep my eyes on the prize, no surprise that I'm lit
Got one hand on the blunt, other hand on the whip
I be cruisin', you be snoozin'
That's why you losin', I'm oozin'
Confidence is boomin', boomin'

Clarity, I got clarity
I'm the bitch with the sauce, apparently
Give a few of y'all drip, that's charity
I ain't worried 'bout shit

I ain't worried 'bout nada
'Less it Gucci, 'less it Prada
'Less it Dolce or Gabbana
'Less a trip to the Bahamas
I wanna feel like Madonna
I wanna feel like I'm way up
Crew ain't pullin' up until you pay us
Made another hit, no lay-up
Stay lit every single day I wake up

Clarity, I got clarity
I'm the bitch with the sauce, apparently
Give a few of y'all drip, that's charity
I ain't worried 'bout shit, you a parody
Clarity, I got clarity
VVS's 'round my neck, now they stare at me
Ain't no wonder why they all so scared of me
I'm a rarity, I got clarity

Woo-ah!
