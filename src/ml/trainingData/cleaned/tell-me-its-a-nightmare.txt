Tell me how we got here
I see you but you're not there
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price
Tell me it's a nightmare
And you ain't going nowhere
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price

Should've seen it coming, baby
Should've seen it in my eyes
It's not like I never told ya
Shouldn't come as a surprise
You were high on the adrenaline
And you always wanted more
I'm a demon in the shadows
And you stepped into the dark

I confess this, I can't stop
I'm possessive, I chew you up
You took everything I gave ya
But you always wanted more
(Be careful what you wish for)

Tell me how we got here
I see you but you're not there
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price
Tell me it's a nightmare (Tell me it's a nightmare)
And you ain't going nowhere (And you ain't going nowhere)
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price, yeah

It's running through my veins
And it's everything I touch
Be careful when you love me
I'm only out for blood
You know I'd be the end of you
But you always wanted more
(Be careful what you wish for)

Tell me how we got here (Tell me how we got here)
I see you but you're not there (I see you but you're not there)
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price
Tell me it's a nightmare (Tell me it's a nightmare)
And you ain't going nowhere (And you ain't going nowhere)
Tried to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Tried to stop ya, but you paid the price
You paid the price

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

(Woo-ah!)
