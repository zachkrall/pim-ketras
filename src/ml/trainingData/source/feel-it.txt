This night, this beauty
The stars around me
Nothing more I could say
It's you and me
And no one else here
Nothing will stay the same

Because you were never here, never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you see I really want to stay with you
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something?
It's there, it's there, it's there

There's something in the air
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel it
One day is not enough
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel the rush

Na-na na na na na...

I felt so lonely
Without you only
Now I'm back in your arms
Stay tonight
I'll do what you like
I will do you no harm

Because you're never here or never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you tell I really want you to stay with me
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something
It's there, it's there, it's there

Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
In the air

There's something in the air
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel it
One day is not enough
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel the rush
Feel the touch
Wait up 'til dawn and see those thoughts
I'm asking you
Wish you can stay the night
I'm wanting you to feel it
I can feel it, feel it, feel

Na-na na na na na....
