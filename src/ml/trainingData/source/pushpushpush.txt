[Verse 1]
I could stay up all night
Keep flipping up the eyes, oh
I'm walking on the line
But baby, I don't mind

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause ooh, you get my heart rate up
Temperature go to the top
When you (push the button, push the button)
Ooh, there's something in the way
That you laid your eyes on me
Yeah, you do

[Chorus]
But I can't wait till you get closer
You make it look like it's supposed to
And if you're hotter than Miami
Then baby, I'mma lay down
I'mma lay down, I'mma lay down

[Post-Chorus]
All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh, push, push, push, push
All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh-ooh, push, push, push

[Verse 2]
(Ahh-ah)
My mind keeps going down
(Down)
I guess I'm not the only one
But you got it right
A sublime amount of high
Got me losing track of time
But I, I, I don't mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You get my heart rate up
Temperature go to the top
When you (push the button, push the button)
Ooh, there's something in the way
That you laid your eyes on me
Yeah, you do
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
But I can't wait till you get closer
You make it look like it's supposed to
And if you're hotter than Miami
Then baby, I'mma lay down
I'mma lay down, I'mma lay down

[Post-Chorus]
All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh, push, push, push, push
All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh-ooh, yeah, push, push, push

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
But I can't wait till you get closer
You make it look like it's supposed to
And if you're hotter than Miami
Then baby, I'mma lay down
I'mma lay down, I'mma lay down

[Post-Chorus]
All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh, push, push, push, push
All you got to do
Is push, push, push, push
Ooh-ooh, yeah, push, push, push
All you gotta do is
All you gotta do is
Push, push, push, push
All you gotta do, eh
All you gotta do, ooh
Push, push, push
