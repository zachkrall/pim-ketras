[Verse 1]
I don't need your credential
But show me what you really want
W-what you really want
That good, that extra special
Tell me you'd go overboard
Go-go-go overboard

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me on top (top!)
Take me up over all the above (all the above)
Yeah, put it on lock (lock!)
One or the other way round
You jumped the pond
Oh, will you stop? (stop!)
Pick up a number and dial
Show me you tried
Got it on lock (lock!)
One or the other way round
Other way round
(Let go)

[Chorus]
I don't need miracles
All I can say
Is baby, it's a matter of your devotion
And if you give it time
Maybe I'll make you my guy
But I ain't talking puddles, I'm talking oceans

[Post-Chorus]
Woo-ooh
Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-ooh
Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-ooh
Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't talking puddles, I'm talking oceans

[Verse 2]
Overtime is essential
If it's what you really want
W-what you really want
Show me your full potential
Can you walk the mile or not
Use up your MileagePlus

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me on top (top!)
Take me up over all the above (all the above)
Yeah, put it on lock (lock!)
One or the other way round
You jumped the pond
Oh, will you stop? (stop!)
Pick up a number and dial
Show me you tried
Got it on lock (lock!)
One or the other way round
Other way round
(Let go)

[Chorus]
I don't need miracles
All I can say
Is baby, it's a matter of your devotion
And if you give it time
Maybe I'll make you my guy
But I ain't talking puddles, I'm talking oceans

[Post-Chorus]
Woo-ooh
Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-ooh
Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-ooh
Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't talking puddles, I'm talking oceans

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I don't need miracles
All I can say
Is baby, it's a matter of your devotion
And if you give it time
Maybe I'll make you my guy
But I ain't talking puddles, I'm talking oceans

[Post-Chorus]
Woo-ooh
Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-ooh
Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-ooh
Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, Y-y-yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't talking puddles, I'm talking oceans
