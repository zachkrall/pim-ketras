[Verse 1]
I need you more than air
I see you everywhere
Nobody else compares
I don't go anywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

[Chorus]
All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
Thought that you were the exception
Took a fatal blow to my heart
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you

[Verse 2]
Wish I could forget ya, like I never met ya
Said you wanna break, then you broke my heart
You left me with nothing, I feel like I'm drowning
You just let me down and I don't know why
Wish that I could say that you're dead to me
What's it gonna take to feel alive again?
I feel like I'm breaking, I keep medicating
I just can't believe that it's over now

[Bridge]
All I do is cry about you
All I do is cry
You're always in my head
Feels like I'm living dead
Remember when you said that this would never end?

[Pre-Chorus]
Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

[Chorus]
All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
Thought that you were the exception
Took a fatal blow to my heart
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you (All I do is cry about you)

[Verse 2]
Wish I could forget ya, like I never met ya
Said you wanna break, then you broke my heart
You left me with nothing, I feel like I'm drowning
You just let me down and I don't know why
Wish that I could say that you're dead to me
What's it gonna take to feel alive again?
I feel like I'm breaking, I keep medicating
I just can't believe that it's over now

[Outro]
All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you
