[Verse 1]
Any time that you like
Gonna give you my heart to break
Angel eyes, tell me lies
Gonna give you my heart to break

[Pre-Chorus]
One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying "yes"
Where's my self control? Ah
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more

[Chorus]
Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby, it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break
I tried to fight, but I can't help it
Don't care if this is my worst mistake
'Cause no one else could do it better
And that's why I give you my heart to break

[Verse 2]
Butterflies every time
Gonna give you my heart to break
Devilish, uh, every kiss
Gonna give you my heart to break, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying "yes"
Where's my self control? Ah
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more

[Chorus]
Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby, it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break
I tried to fight, but I can't help it
Don't care if this is my worst mistake (no)
'Cause no one else could do it better (No one else, better, and that's why I...)
And that's why I give you my heart to break

[Bridge]
Every time
Heart to break
Woo-ah!
Every time
Heart to break
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying "yes"
Where's my self control? Ah
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more, more, more

[Chorus]
Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby, it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break
I tried to fight, but I can't help it (I tried to fight... help it)
Don't care if this is my worst mistake
'Cause no one else could do it better (No one else, better, and that's why I...)
And that's why I give you my heart to break
